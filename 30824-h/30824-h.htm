<h1>THE RUSHTON BOYS AT TREASURE COVE</h1>

<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COMING STORM</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Say, boys, it looks like a storm and a heavy one, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jest and laughter ceased at once, and three pairs of eyes looked in the
direction pointed out by the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that big bank of cloud climbing up the sky?&#8221; continued Fred
Rushton. &#8220;There&#8217;s more than a capful of wind in that, if I know
anything about weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Fred,&#8221; said Lester Lee, who was handling the
tiller. &#8220;And we&#8217;re a long way off from home! It&#8217;s up to us to
turn about and make a run for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think it will amount to anything,&#8221; said Teddy
Rushton, Fred&#8217;s younger brother, who was never averse to taking a chance.
&#8220;We&#8217;re having <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_2'></a>2</span> such a grand time that I hate to make a break for land
unless we have to. Besides, I&#8217;ve never been out in a squall, and I&#8217;d
like to have the experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have more experience than you cared for with this blow
that is coming,&#8221; returned the helmsman, and there was a growing anxiety in
his tone. &#8220;I&#8217;m more familiar with this coast than you are, and
I&#8217;d rather look at the storm from the shore than from the deck of this
catboat. So, here&#8217;s for a quick scoot for home,&#8221; he concluded, as he
brought the boat around and laid the course for the shore.</p>

<p>It was a staunch little sailboat of twenty-two feet in length, and the way
she minded her helm, as well as the ease with which she rode the waves, spoke
eloquently of her qualities.</p>

<p>On this afternoon, off the coast of Maine, she held a jolly party of four
boys. Lester Lee, who owned the boat and managed the tiller, was the host, and
his guests were Bill Garwood and Fred and Teddy Rushton, all of them fellow
schoolmates of Lester&#8217;s at Rally Hall. It was vacation time, and the boys
were gloating over the fact that they were going to have several weeks more than
usual before school opened in the fall. The news had come in a letter that Fred
had received that morning from Melvin Granger, one of his last year&#8217;s
chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for old Mel!&#8221; exulted Teddy. &#8220;He knew <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span> how good we&#8217;d feel
about it, and he couldn&#8217;t get the news to us quickly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That stroke of lightning knew its business when it struck the right
wing of the building,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;Mel says that several of the
rooms were burned out, and it will be fully a month after the usual time before
everything can be got in running order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet old Hardtack is raving, because he can&#8217;t get us
under his thumb as soon as he expected,&#8221; grinned Bill, referring in this
irreverent fashion to Dr. Hardach Rally, head of Rally Hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky the lightning didn&#8217;t hit the gymnasium,
anyway,&#8221; commented Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have some tough teams to
tackle this coming year and we&#8217;ll need all the practice we can get. Ease
her off a little, Fred,&#8221; he added, to the older Rushton boy, who was
handling the sheet.</p>

<p>Fred did so, just in time to avoid the full force of a big wave that was
coming on the port side. But enough of it came aboard to drench thoroughly Teddy
and Bill, who were lounging at the foot of the mast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; yelled Teddy, as he scrambled to his feet. &#8220;That was
a corker. I got a gallon down my back that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gallon?&#8221; echoed Bill. &#8220;It seemed to me more like a
hogshead. I&#8217;m as wet as a drowned rat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care, fellows,&#8221; called out Lester. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span> &#8220;We won&#8217;t any of
us have a dry stitch on by the time we get to land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s any danger, do you?&#8221; asked
Bill, who at his father&#8217;s ranch would have been perfectly at home on the
back of a bucking broncho, but here on the sea felt out of his element.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Lester, carelessly. &#8220;That is,&#8221; he
hastened to add, &#8220;there&#8217;s always more or less danger when
one&#8217;s out in an open boat in a storm. But this <i>Ariel</i> of mine is a
jim dandy, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have any trouble. Even if she
should go over, we could hang on to the bottom, and there are so many boats in
these waters that we&#8217;d soon be picked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite his careless air and confident words, it was evident from the way he
scanned the sky and the tumbling waste of waters that he was secretly
uneasy.</p>

<p>The sky had by this time become completely overcast, and although it was only
mid afternoon, it was as dark as though twilight were coming on. The wind came
in stronger gusts, and the waves broke ever more threateningly against the side
of the boat. The land was blotted out, and only the tossing waters met the view
in every direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have turned around sooner,&#8221; Lester muttered to
himself, &#8220;but I was so interested in the letter that Fred got from Mel I
didn&#8217;t notice those storm clouds coming up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>The conversation had
ceased. Lester had all he could do to handle the tiller and shape his course,
and Fred had to be on the alert in his management of the sheet, which strained
and tugged under the force of the wind. It was a time for action rather than
speech, and Bill and Teddy, who just then could do nothing but serve as ballast,
looked on in silence as the <i>Ariel</i> tore through the waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly an object that appeared on the starboard side excited Teddy so much
that a cry broke from his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that big fish over there!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a monster. What is it, a porpoise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Porpoise nothing,&#8221; said Lester briefly, letting his eye wander a
moment from the tiller. &#8220;That&#8217;s a shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shark!&#8221; was the cry that broke at the same time from Teddy and
Bill, neither of whom had even seen that &#8220;pirate of the sea,&#8221; and
they felt a shivery thrill from the sudden discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Lester, &#8220;and from the size of the fin, he
must be a whopper. We seldom see them so large in these waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a man-eater, do you think?&#8221; asked Bill in an awed
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a blue
shark or a hammerhead, he probably is. They pulled one out about fifty miles
from here last year, and when they cut him up, they found a man&#8217;s boot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span> in his stomach.
They&#8217;re good things to keep away from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say they were,&#8221; agreed Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
take my chance with a rattlesnake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they lapsed into silence, but their eyes never left that ominous fin
that showed just above the water, cutting it like a knife.</p>

<p>There was a quick exclamation from Lester, and looking at him, they saw that
he was peering at an object perhaps half a mile away. It was large and vague in
the gathering darkness, but Bill&#8217;s keen eyes, accustomed to gaze over wide
spaces in the West, made it out at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a motor boat!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;And by jinks! it
seems to be in trouble. See how it tosses about. It looks as if it would upset
any minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those motor boats are always unsafe,&#8221; remarked Lester, with the
scorn that the master of a sailboat usually feels for any craft driven by
machinery. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting out of order all the time, and a fellow
takes his life in his hands every time he goes out in one. For my part give me a
sailboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see how many people are on board of her?&#8221; asked Fred
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see only one,&#8221; replied Bill, &#8220;and he seems to be
tinkering with the engine. Wow! but she shipped a lot of water just
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; asked Teddy. &#8220;He <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span> may get upset, and if he
doesn&#8217;t know how to swim, he&#8217;ll drown. And even if he were a good
swimmer, he couldn&#8217;t make the shore in a storm like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; said Lester briefly, as he gave the
tiller a twist and gave Fred directions to pull in the sheet. In a moment the
boat had changed its course and was bearing down swiftly toward the disabled
craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty anxious to get to shore,&#8221; Lester remarked,
&#8220;but we&#8217;ve got to see what we can do for this fellow
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The storm was now full upon them, and the <i>Ariel</i> staggered as the waves
beat against her sides. She ploughed along gallantly, however, under the skilful
guidance of Lester, riding most of the waves, although now and then her nose
would dive through a big one and enough water would come on board to keep Bill
and Teddy busy bailing her out. All were thoroughly drenched, but no one thought
of his discomfort, so intent were they all on reaching the motor boat, which by
this time was absolutely out of control and tossing up and down like a chip in
the surging tumult of waters.</p>

<p>The one occupant had given up as hopeless the attempt to fix the machinery.
He had caught sight of the <i>Ariel</i> and was waving his hands wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He oughtn&#8217;t to be standing up,&#8221; muttered Lester. &#8220;He
ought to crouch down and hold tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were now not more than a hundred feet <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_8'></a>8</span> away, when suddenly a groan went up from the boys.</p>

<p>A huge wave, cresting over the side, had caught the man on the motor boat
full in the chest and hurled him into the sea!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>DRAGGED FROM THE SEA</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221; cried Teddy in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that shark around!&#8221; exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; yelled Fred, as his straining eyes caught sight of
a white face and a struggling figure at a little distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by with the boat hooks,&#8221; commanded Lester to Bill and
Teddy, as he gave the <i>Ariel</i> a turn and bore down on the drowning man.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who have followed the adventures of the Rushton boys, as
told in the previous volumes of this series, entitled &#8220;The Rushton Boys at
Rally Hall&#8221; and &#8220;The Rushton Boys in the Saddle,&#8221; already feel
well acquainted with them and the other occupants of the boat. Those who have
not yet done so will need a word of introduction.</p>

<p>Fred and Teddy Rushton were the sons of Mansfield Rushton, a broker, living
in Oldtown and doing business in an adjacent city, to which he commuted. He and
his wife, Agnes, were devoted to their boys, and their home was a type of all
that is best and wholesome in American life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>An occasional
disturbing element in it was the frequent presence of the boys&#8217; uncle,
Aaron Rushton, who was a crusty bachelor with little liking for boys. He was
constantly preaching the need of a firm hand in bringing up his nephews and
scolding his brother for his laxity in that respect.</p>

<p>Fred, who was nearly sixteen, was a year older than Teddy. Both were alert
and vigorous young Americans, bright in their studies and fond of athletic
sports. Teddy was impulsive and given to playing practical jokes, and a large
part of Fred&#8217;s time was taken up in getting his brother out of
trouble.</p>

<p>One of Teddy&#8217;s jokes caused a runaway in which their Uncle Aaron nearly
came to grief. He escaped personal injury, but lost his watch and some valuable
papers, and he was so angry that at last the boys&#8217; parents sent them to
Rally Hall, a boarding school recommended by Mr. Aaron Rushton because its
discipline was very strict.</p>

<p>The boys enjoyed themselves hugely at Rally Hall, for the year was crowded
with fun and adventure. They had enemies as well as warm friends, and Fred had
to thrash Andy Shanks, a bully who tried to put on him the theft of some
examination papers.</p>

<p>When vacation time arrived, they arranged to go out to the Snake River Ranch
in the West, to visit Bill Garwood, one of their chums at Rally <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span> Hall. They expected to
have a glorious time and were not disappointed. For the first time, they saw
rattlesnakes and bears that were not behind bars in a Zoological Garden. A
tangled web of events was being wound around Mr. Garwood, Bill&#8217;s father,
in the effort of plotters to get possession of his ranch where, unknown to him,
a silver mine had been discovered. Teddy, by means of a moving-picture film
taken by a company at the ranch, was enabled to run down a plot to steal Mr.
Garwood&#8217;s cattle, and Fred had a chance to unmask a pretended ghost by
which it was sought to frighten people away from the location of the mine.</p>

<p>Their grateful hosts wanted the boys to stay all summer, but they had to cut
their visit short, as they had promised to spend a few weeks with Lester Lee at
Bartanet Shoals on the coast of Maine. The lads had now been with Lester for
about two weeks, and Bill, who had joined them on Lester&#8217;s earnest
invitation, had come a few days later. They had had, so far, what Teddy called a
&#8220;bang-up time&#8221; and the only thing that marred their pleasure was the
fact that vacation was so nearly over. Hence their delight at the news in
Melvin&#8217;s letter that, owing to an injury to one of the buildings, the fall
term at Rally Hall would open about a month later than usual.</p>

<p>Lester had lived on the coast all his life and there was nothing about
handling a sailboat that he did <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span> not know, but it taxed all his skill to rescue the
man who had been thrown into the water. Had the sea been smooth, it would have
been an easy matter to wear about and pull him on board. But in this welter of
wind and waves, it was all he could do to get the <i>Ariel</i> to obey her helm.
Twice he swooped down near the struggling swimmer, but each time the waves beat
the man back just far enough to be out of reach of the boathooks. Lester was
coming round for another attempt when he was startled by a cry from Teddy:</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes! He&#8217;s given up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The strength of the swimmer had failed. For another moment his arms moved
aimlessly. Then he slowly sank from sight.</p>

<p>The boys looked at one another in horror.</p>

<p>Fred was the first to recover from his paralysis. He kicked off his shoes and
thrust the rope of the sheet into Teddy&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold this, Ted,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and do just what Lester
tells you to do. You, Bill, hold on tight to this end of the line,&#8221; he
added, picking up a coil at his feet, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll take the other.
Leave plenty of slack till you see me come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost before they knew what he intended to do, Fred dived overboard.</p>

<p>The sides of the <i>Ariel</i> were high and his dive carried the boy far
down. Down, down he went, looking through the dim green waters for a white <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span> face and limp form. But
his efforts were useless and he came up for air.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; were the first words he heard, as he shook his
head and looked around. &#8220;Over there to the right. Grab him, Fred, before
he goes down again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred made a wild clutch at an object just beside him, and his fingers
clutched an arm. He held on desperately, despite the waves that sought to tear
him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; yelled Bill. &#8220;Hold tight now and
I&#8217;ll pull you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no movement in the limp form, which made it easier for his
preserver. Holding tightly with one hand to the rope which had never left his
grip, and grasping his unconscious burden with the other, Fred was drawn to the
side of the <i>Ariel</i> by Bill&#8217;s muscular arms. But the strength of all
three was necessary to lift the two of them on board, so Lester had to abandon
the rudder, while Teddy left the sheet to help. They succeeded at last, after a
vast amount of tugging and straining, and laid the stranger&#8217;s body on the
deck, while Fred slumped down beside him trying to get back his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t a man at all!&#8221; exclaimed Bill.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a boy and I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s any older than we
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;I wonder who he is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen that fellow somewhere,&#8221; affirmed Lester, &#8220;but for the life of
me I can&#8217;t tell where. But that can wait till another time. What we want
to do now is to get to work. He can&#8217;t have swallowed much water in the
little time he was under. Get him down on his back with his head low. Tear his
shirt open at the throat. Work his arms slowly up and down. Here, Bill, you take
one arm and Teddy the other. You&#8217;ll have to do it without much help from
Fred and me, for we&#8217;ll have all we can do to get this boat to shore. The
wind&#8217;s getting stronger every minute and we simply must reach land before
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He resumed the tiller, while Fred again took the sheet, and they swung the
boat around to its original course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to save the motor boat if we could,&#8221; remarked
Lester, as they swung around. &#8220;It looks as though it had cost a heap of
money. But just now it&#8217;s a question of life rather than money, and
we&#8217;ll have to let it go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem a pity,&#8221; agreed Fred, as he glanced at the boat
tossing about helplessly, now wallowing in the trough and again rising to the
crest of a wave. &#8220;But perhaps it may keep afloat till the storm is over.
We&#8217;ll cruise around and look for it to-morrow or next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill and Teddy were working vigorously, applying all their knowledge of
&#8220;first aid&#8221; to their unconscious <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_15'></a>15</span> passenger. For several minutes their work seemed to
be without result, but at last they heaved sighs of relief as they saw a beating
at the temples and a fluttering of the eyelids. A moment later the stranger
opened his eyes and looked vaguely around him. He tried to speak, but no words
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk just now,&#8221; Teddy admonished him.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been in a tight pinch, but you&#8217;re all right. Just
relax and go to sleep if you want to. We&#8217;re on the job and we&#8217;ll
take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes closed again, and the boys, seeing that the danger was past, stopped
their &#8220;pump-handle work,&#8221; as Teddy called it, and set about making
the stranger&#8217;s position more comfortable. They made a rough bed for him
with some blankets that they dragged from the tiny cabin and put a coat beneath
his head for a pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The longer he stays asleep, the better it will be for him,&#8221;
commented Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for him it isn&#8217;t his last sleep,&#8221; said
Teddy. &#8220;It would have been that, if it hadn&#8217;t been for that brother
of mine,&#8221; he added with a touch of pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred surely is a plucky old scout and a quick thinker too,&#8221;
agreed Bill. &#8220;He had his shoes off and was in the water before the rest of
us fairly realized what had happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can swim like a fish,&#8221; said Teddy, &#8220;and with <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> that rope in his hand, I
didn&#8217;t fear but we could get him on board again. But my heart was in my
mouth when I thought of that shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was taking a big risk,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;By the way, I
don&#8217;t see anything more of that ugly fin. I guess he&#8217;s given us the
go-by for to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, there was a rush in the water alongside, and they
caught a glimpse of a dark body at least sixteen feet in length, and saw a
wicked eye gleaming up at them. It was only for a second and again the shark
vanished. But his sudden appearance, at the very moment they were talking of
him, made the boys shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s following us!&#8221; exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;He knows we&#8217;re in a
small boat and that the storm may capsize it. If it were a canoe or a rowboat,
he&#8217;d probably try to upset it himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have been far off when Fred was in the water,&#8221;
shivered Bill. &#8220;He may have been making for him at the very minute we
hauled him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got both out just in the nick of time, I guess,&#8221; assented
Teddy soberly, and his heart was full of thankfulness as he gazed at his elder
brother.</p>

<p>The latter just at present had his hands full. The storm had increased in
fury and was now blowing half a gale. The sail threatened to split into ribbons,
and the gunwale was constantly under <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_17'></a>17</span> water as the <i>Ariel</i> plunged along.
Lester&#8217;s muscles were strained to the utmost to hold the rudder against
the heavy waves that seemed bound to disable it.</p>

<p>His face was set and worried, as he glanced alternately at sea and sky. He
seemed to be debating a question that bothered him. At last he reached a
decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he said as he jammed over the tiller and
changed the course of the <i>Ariel</i>. &#8220;We&#8217;ll never make Bartanet
Shoals with the wind as it is now. We&#8217;d have to do too much tacking and
beating up into the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do then?&#8221; inquired Fred anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make for a cove I know of, where we can wait till the
storm is over,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll have to do some
tall hustling to get there before night comes on. Here goes for a run before the
wind.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A WELCOME REFUGE</span></h2>

<p>The change of course had not been effected without shipping a considerable
amount of water as the boat hung for a moment in the wind. Bill and Teddy bailed
desperately, and an instant later the <i>Ariel</i> was heading in a new
direction. The wind now, instead of striking her sail at an angle, was following
directly over the stern, and the little craft fairly flew. The power of the wind
made her careen at a dangerous angle, and Bill and Teddy had to climb up on the
further side to keep her from capsizing.</p>

<p>It was perilous sailing, but the bite of the salt spray on their cheeks and
the swift pace at which they were moving filled the boys with wild exhilaration.
They might have been four young Vikings out on a voyage of discovery, as they
faced and dared the storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how she foots it through the water!&#8221; exclaimed Lester.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet she is!&#8221; responded Teddy with enthusiasm. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t wonder that sailors get so fond of their boats that they&#8217;d
rather go down with them than live without them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>&#8220;I
can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve got so far as that,&#8221; laughed Lester.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d feel as bad about losing the <i>Ariel</i> as
you boys would if you lost Star and Colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d feel mighty bad then,&#8221; responded Teddy, as he
thought of the horses that he and Fred had brought with them from the West.</p>

<p>At this moment, his attention was attracted by a movement on the part of the
boy they had rescued. They had sheltered him as much they could, but they could
not prevent an occasional dash of spray from striking his face and this had
hastened his awakening. This time, his eyes were lighted with intelligence, and
it was clear that he had largely recovered from the effect of his immersion.</p>

<p>Teddy bent over toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221; he asked with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better,&#8221; was the response in a faint voice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
remember yet, though, just what happened to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A big wave threw you overboard,&#8221; broke in Bill. &#8220;We
happened to be cruising near by, and we picked you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I must have hit my head against something when I went
over,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember a thing that
happened while I was in the water. Did I swim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seemed to be swimming a little,&#8221; said <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span> Teddy, &#8220;but I guess it was more
instinct than anything else. You went down before we got to you. But you&#8217;d
better not talk any more just now. We&#8217;ll be on shore before long I hope,
and then we&#8217;ll tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the shore now,&#8221; called out Bill in accents of
relief, as he pointed to a long dark line ahead of them.</p>

<p>On the right it seemed to be sandy and level, but a little to the left there
was a rocky elevation, against which the waves broke with a thunderous roar,
sending back sheets of crested foam.</p>

<p>The boat kept on with unslackened speed and the boys grew somewhat uneasy as
the tumbling breakers grew plainer to the sight. But that uneasiness became
consternation, when Lester with a quick twist of the tiller headed the
<i>Ariel</i> straight toward two immense rocks that seemed to stand out as
sentinels on the coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester!&#8221; shouted Bill in warning and then stopped. A look at the
strained intent face of the helmsman told Bill that he knew exactly what he was
doing.</p>

<p>They came nearer and nearer, and the faces of the boys blanched at the
fearful turmoil of the breakers. Then Lester threw the tiller to port.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit tight!&#8221; he yelled, and the next moment the <i>Ariel</i>
dashed straight for a point midway between the two giant rocks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>There was an awful
moment as she staggered through that seething turmoil of raging waters. But this
was followed by an immense relief when they found themselves rocking on the
waters of a sheltered cove, which, while rough, were like a mill pond compared
to the sea outside.</p>

<p>Before them stretched a sandy beach, which bore no trace of human habitation
except a tumbled down hut which stood fifty feet inland. A few scrub pines were
scattered here and there, and some dejected looking bushes grew in a little
patch of green that the sand had not yet swallowed up. It was not an attractive
landscape, but to the boys, after escaping the perils of the sea, it seemed a
bit of Paradise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower the sail, Fred,&#8221; directed Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get
out the sweeps and feel our way to a landing place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sail came down with a run, and Fred rose and stretched himself after
having been so long in a cramped position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester, you&#8217;re some sailor,&#8221; he said in hearty admiration.
&#8220;You handled the <i>Ariel</i> to the queen&#8217;s taste. I take off my
hat to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; echoed Teddy. &#8220;It certainly looked as if it
were all up with us when you came shooting toward these rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a dandy bit of work,&#8221; said Bill warmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a lucky thing for this crowd that you were at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_22'></a>22</span> the helm. If you hadn&#8217;t been, we might be food
for the fishes by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Lester, flushing a little at
the chorus of appreciation. &#8220;I just happened to know of this place, and I
knew we had to get to shore before dark. So I took a chance on making it. But
it&#8217;s nearly dark now, and we&#8217;ve got a lot to do, before we&#8217;re
snug and tidy for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing to do is to find a shallow place where you fellows can
wade ashore. Then I&#8217;ll take the <i>Ariel</i> out a way and anchor her. As
soon as that&#8217;s done, I&#8217;ll swim ashore and join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They poled the boat in carefully with a pair of long sweeps until their
soundings showed them that they were in less than three feet of water. Here Bill
and the two Rushton boys jumped overboard, and while they held out their arms to
him, Lester carefully let down the stranger. He could walk by this time,
although he was still weak and shaky, and the boys helped him to the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you sit here for a while,&#8221; said Fred, when they had reached
a point twenty feet or so up the beach, &#8220;while the rest of us hustle
around and get something to eat. Do you feel hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to,&#8221; smiled the other. &#8220;I guess I can
punish my part of the supper pretty well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Fred heartily. &#8220;That reminds me. Say,
Lester!&#8221; he called, as he waded back, &#8220;hand <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span> us over that string of bluefish.
It&#8217;s lucky we caught them before the storm came up. Is there anything left
from the lunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;You wolves went through
that lunch like a prairie fire. But I&#8217;ve got some slices of bacon in the
locker, and here&#8217;s some salt and pepper. I guess we won&#8217;t go
hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not from the looks of that string we won&#8217;t,&#8221; laughed Fred,
as he received from Lester enough bluefish to feed a dozen men. &#8220;Now hand
over the other things, and by the time you anchor and come ashore, we&#8217;ll
be ready to fill you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a big contract,&#8221; grinned Lester, &#8220;but
I&#8217;m going to hold you to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He poled the <i>Ariel</i> out a little way and dropped the anchor. Then he
made everything shipshape about the little craft, slipped into the water, and
swam ashore.</p>

<p>He found that his comrades had not been idle. Teddy had ransacked the hut and
found an old frying pan and a bent up broiler, probably left there by the
hunters that made this their rendezvous in the sniping season. Bill collected
all the shrubs and twigs that he could find, and taking a match from an oilskin
pouch started a fire. Fred was busy with his clasp knife, cleaning the fish, and
when Lester reached them, he had half a dozen speckled beauties ready for the
frying pan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s
use the busted broiler instead,&#8221; suggested Lester. &#8220;Bluefish are
twice as good broiled as they are fried. We&#8217;ll use the frying pan for the
bacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fish would be better yet, if we had some oak twigs to broil them
on, instead of the broiler,&#8221; said Bill, whose experience in camping out
made him an expert adviser, &#8220;but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any wood
around here except pine. And the flavor of that spoils the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they compromised on the dilapidated broiler, holding the fish over a fire
of embers that they raked out from the main blaze. Bill busied himself with the
bacon, and the appetizing odors that blended together made the hungry boys wild
with anticipation.</p>

<p>At last the meal was ready, and they found it a feast fit for a king. They
had no forks, but they used their knives as substitutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eating with your knife, Fred!&#8221; said Teddy, in mock horror.
&#8220;What would mother say if she saw you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am some sword swallower,&#8221; grinned Fred. &#8220;But
we&#8217;re all in the same boat, and everything goes. I don&#8217;t suppose
Robinson Crusoe and Friday were very particular about their table manners. And
this is certainly a Robinson Crusoe stunt we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except that this isn&#8217;t an island,&#8221; laughed Lester.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;And there
are no cannibals ready to make us into soup,&#8221; added Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;And our boat hasn&#8217;t been wrecked,&#8221; exulted Teddy, looking
out over the water, where the <i>Ariel</i> lay with the firelight reflected from
her side.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A STRANGE MISSION</span></h2>

<p>It seemed to the boys as though they could never get enough, and Fred, as he
saw one bluefish after another vanish, reminded the others that they would want
something for breakfast the next morning. But at last even their ravenous
appetites were satisfied, and they lay back on the sand, blissfully content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy camping,&#8221; remarked Teddy lazily. &#8220;No dishes to wash,
no beds to make, nothing to do till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the storm will be over by that time, Lester?&#8221; asked
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; answered Lester, as he looked up at the sky where
some stars showed through. &#8220;The clouds seem to be breaking away and the
wind has died down a little. The surf doesn&#8217;t sound so loud on the cliffs
outside, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose your father will be worried when we don&#8217;t get back
to-night,&#8221; remarked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he will,&#8221; assented Lester. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve had to stay away sometimes before when I&#8217;ve been caught in a
squall, and he knows the <i>Ariel</i> is <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_27'></a>27</span> a pretty staunch boat. Still, he can&#8217;t help
feeling worried, and we&#8217;ll make sail for home the first thing in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, their clothes had dried in the warmth of the fire, and the
comfort that this gave, together with the hearty meal they had eaten, put the
youths in a state of supreme content. They were at peace with themselves and
with all the world, and their satisfaction was all the greater by contrast with
their peril of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The stranger had eaten heartily and joined freely in the conversation, but by
tacit consent they had waited till the meal was over before they discussed his
narrow escape. The Rally Hall boys had had time to take the unknown one&#8217;s
measure, and the general impression was favorable.</p>

<p>He was a clean-cut, well set up youth of about sixteen years. His form was
lithe and muscular, his hair black, and his eyes frank and friendly. His speech
showed education, and his manners were easy and correct.</p>

<p>If there was anything about him that marked him out as peculiar, it was a
certain baffled expression that came and went in his eyes. He looked like one
who was always seeking for something, but never finding it. His glance had taken
in the cove and the surrounding shore, as though to impress it on his memory,
with a view to using the knowledge later on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>Now as the boys
lounged around the fire, he seemed to feel that the time had come to give some
account of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you fellows enough for having pulled me out of the
water,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the fellow to thank,&#8221; interrupted Lester, clapping
his hand on Fred&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;He went overboard after
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; was the surprised reply. &#8220;I thought you pulled me
in from the deck. That was an awfully plucky thing for you to do,&#8221; the
stranger declared, as he grasped Fred&#8217;s hand warmly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
never forget it. With that shark swimming around there, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was nothing,&#8221; disclaimed Fred. &#8220;I had tight hold
of a rope, and it was no trick at all to hold on to you until the other fellows
pulled us in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You took your life in your hand just the same,&#8221; affirmed the
other. &#8220;I hope that some day I&#8217;ll be able to show you how much I
appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter with your motor boat anyway?&#8221; asked Fred,
who was always embarrassed by thanks and wanted to change the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ignition was bad, and the water that I shipped made things worse.
I was tinkering away at it and had almost got it to working right, when that big
wave came aboard and carried me over the side. I can just remember its hitting
me, and after <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span> that
everything was blank until I came to my senses on the deck of the
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen that motor boat of yours cruising up and down the
coast a good deal this last year or so,&#8221; remarked Lester. &#8220;You seem
to be pretty fond of the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger shot a swift glance at the last speaker, as if he thought some
hidden meaning might lurk behind the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m never happier than when
I&#8217;m out on the open sea. Some of my ancestors must have been sailors I
guess, and I have it in the blood. But that isn&#8217;t the only reason
I&#8217;ve been cruising along this coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the reason then?&#8221; asked Teddy curiously. &#8220;That
is,&#8221; he went on hastily, &#8220;if you care to tell us. We don&#8217;t
want to pry into your affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other seemed to debate with himself. It was as if a habit of secrecy were
battling with a sudden desire for expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; he burst out. &#8220;It&#8217;s a thing
I&#8217;ve never told any one else. But you fellows have been so white to me, to
say nothing of one of you having risked his life for mine, that I&#8217;m going
to take a chance. Perhaps it will be a relief anyway. Brooding over it so long
and not confiding in any one, I&#8217;ve been afraid some time I might go crazy
over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were startled, but they gave no sign and the speaker went on:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;My name is
Ross Montgomery. I&#8217;m looking for a chest of gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect was electric. The thrilling phrase appealed to all that was most
romantic in the listeners. Visions floated before their eyes of hidden
treasures, of pirate hoards, of sunken galleons with their doubloons and
&#8220;pieces of eight.&#8221; These things had seemed to belong to the misty
past, to distant seas. Yet here in the prosaic twentieth century, in a civilized
country, on a quiet beach along the coast of Maine, this boy of their own age
was talking of a quest that might well stir the most sluggish blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chest of gold!&#8221; repeated Fred, as though he could not believe
his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you think it&#8217;s hidden?&#8221; questioned Teddy
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money is in the chest?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t money,&#8221; corrected Lester. &#8220;It may
be gold dust, or it may be in bars. Have you any clue?&#8221; he asked, turning
to Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think it&#8217;s on this coast?&#8221; put in Fred.</p>

<p>Ross raised his hand good-naturedly, as though to ward off the rain of
questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy there,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you the whole
thing from the beginning. Perhaps you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m crazy. Perhaps
you&#8217;ll say I have as good a chance of finding it as the fellow who looks
for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow. And you may be right. Anyway, I&#8217;ll give you
what facts I know, and you can figure out for yourselves whether I have a chance
or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross waited a moment to collect his thoughts, and the other boys disposed
themselves to listen. Their blood was bounding and their eyes shining. The
situation was romantic in itself. The firelight played over their eager faces,
the waters of the cove lay shimmering before them, while, at the outlet, the
surf thundered against the rocks. The boys might have been castaways on some
desert island in the tropics. The great world outside seemed very far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was in business in Boston about fifteen years ago,&#8221;
Ross began. &#8220;I was just a baby then, and, of course, I don&#8217;t know
anything about those days except what I&#8217;ve been told since by my
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father was a good business man and he had built up a fairly large
trade. We had a home in a suburb near Boston and all the money we needed. The
business had been expanding, and father had put into it not only all his own
ready money, but a lot that he had borrowed from his friends. Then hard times
came. Of course he had to retrench in every way he could. He took in his sails
and worked hard to weather the storm. He&#8217;d have succeeded, too, but just
as things were looking <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_32'></a>32</span> brighter, a big bank failure knocked him out
completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of sympathy from the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, he came down with brain fever,&#8221;
went on Ross. &#8220;I suppose it was brought on by worry and overwork. Anyway,
when he got on his feet again, everything had gone to smash and he didn&#8217;t
have a cent left. Worse than that, he was in debt for a good many thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father was honest though,&#8221; and there was a touch of pride in the
boy&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Everybody that knew him at all knew that. If his
health had been good, he could have started in all over again, and even some of
the men to whom he owed money would have lent him more to get him on his feet.
But the doctor told him it would be simply suicide for him to go on under the
circumstances, and that he&#8217;d have to go away somewhere and take a long
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of his property had gone to his creditors, but mother owned a
small place up in Canada on the Gulf of St. Lawrence. She had inherited it from
her father, and as it was free and clear, the whole family packed up and went
out there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a complete change from the life we had lived before and my
father&#8217;s health began to mend right away. There was a good deal of
valuable lumber on the place and as there was a good demand <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span> for this, he sold it at a profit. Then,
too, he traded a good deal with the trappers who came out of the forests every
spring with their skins and furs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money began to pile up and father was feeling fine. It wasn&#8217;t so
much because <i>he</i> was getting the money, though of course that was a great
thing, but he was fairly crazy to pay off every cent of the money he owed when
he went into bankruptcy. He was a very proud man and couldn&#8217;t bear to be
in any one&#8217;s debt. I&#8217;ve often heard him say to mother that the day
he stood clear with the world again would be the happiest day of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had kept a careful record of every cent he owed in a little
memorandum book. Here it is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross reached into his pocket and drew out a small morocco-covered book that
gleamed red in the light of the fire.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CHEST OF GOLD</span></h2>

<p>Ross Montgomery turned over the pages rapidly, and the boys could see a
number of accounts in a precise, methodical script.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first two or three years were the hardest,&#8221; the strange boy
went on, &#8220;but after that the money came in fast. Father made a number of
investments in lumber and in fishing interests, and everything he touched seemed
to bring him luck. By the time I was six years old, he had got enough together
to pay all his debts and make him independent for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one funny thing about it, though. He had burned his fingers
so badly in that big bank failure that he never would trust a bank again. Every
dollar he got above what he needed to use in business, he stored away in an oak
chest that he kept in a secret place at home. He had no use for paper money
either. He&#8217;d take it, of course, when he couldn&#8217;t get anything else,
but the first chance he got he&#8217;d change it for gold. Of course it was just
a whim of his, but somehow it made him feel safer. Maybe it was a little mental
twist <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span> left from his
siege of brain fever. At any rate that&#8217;s the way he felt, and he kept
piling up the gold in that old chest. All sorts of money, too, English,
Canadian, French and American coins. I was small then and didn&#8217;t know much
of the value of money, but I can remember once how the pieces shone when father
gathered up a handful and let the coins fall in a shower back into the
chest&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; interrupted Teddy, &#8220;just think of it. A rain of
gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be caught out in such a shower,&#8221; laughed
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wouldn&#8217;t want any umbrella to ward it off either,&#8221;
added Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cork up, you money grabbers, and let Ross go on with his story,&#8221;
Lester laughingly advised.</p>

<p>&#8220;It brought bad luck to father, though,&#8221; said Ross soberly.
&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for that gold he might be alive
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first intimation the boys had had that the lad&#8217;s father was
dead, and they kept a respectful silence during the moment that followed while
Ross seemed struggling with painful memories.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little over nine years ago,&#8221; the boy went on at last,
&#8220;father concluded that he had enough on hand to settle with all his
creditors, capital and interest, and still have enough left to make him
independent for life. He planned to leave mother and me&#8211;I haven&#8217;t
any brothers or sisters&#8211;at home,<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_36'></a>36</span> while he came down to Boston and settled the claims.
Then he was going to pick out a home here and send for us to come to him.
Although he had made the money in Canada, he had always felt homesick for his
own country.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the question came up,&#8221; continued Ross, &#8220;of how he was
to get the money down here. Of course, the safer way would have been to take it
to some Canadian bank and get a draft on Boston. But I&#8217;ve told you of the
bitter feeling he had toward all banks, and he&#8217;d counted so long on
turning over that identical gold to his creditors that he couldn&#8217;t give it
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were a long distance from any large city, and the only way to
travel by sea was to take some sailing vessel that stopped once in a while at a
town near by. There was a good deal of smuggling going on just then between
Canada and this country, and as there was a big profit in it, almost all the
coastwise sailing vessels took a hand in it now and then. Sometimes it would be
opium that had been landed on the Pacific coast and brought over to Quebec.
Then, too, there were French laces and silks and wines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was illegal, but lots of people couldn&#8217;t see much
harm in it. You know how it is with people that come over from Europe to New
York. A vast number of them try to get things in without paying duty and they
think it&#8217;s rather <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_37'></a>37</span> smart to get the best of Uncle Sam. Many who are
honorable in every other way seem to lose that feeling when it comes to
smuggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s wrong, as everything is wrong that breaks the
law, whether we think the law is just or not. But I&#8217;m just saying this to
explain why father was willing to trust himself and his gold on board a
smuggler.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys bent forward eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For that&#8217;s what he did,&#8221; continued Ross. &#8220;There was
a schooner, named the <i>Ranger</i>, that often stopped at the river town near
where we lived. The captain was a man, Ramsay by name, whom father knew and
trusted. His boat did a good deal of legitimate trading, but sandwiched in with
that was quite a lot of smuggling off and on. Still, aside from that, Captain
Ramsay had the reputation of being a strictly honest man, and he and father had
been on friendly terms for years.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the time came, father went on board with all his baggage,
including the chest of gold. Of course he did not take any one in the secret of
what the chest contained. He figured on getting to Boston in a week or ten
days.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the second day out, a tackle block fell from the foremast and laid
Captain Ramsay dead on the deck. He was buried at sea and the first mate took
command of the schooner. And it was right here that the trouble began.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;This first
mate was a Portuguese, a good sailor, but aside from that I guess he was as big
a villain as ever went unhung. There were five others in the crew, and they
didn&#8217;t seem to be much better than the mate. Captain Ramsay had been a
rough captain and had been able to hold the men down, but as soon as he had gone
things began to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment while the boys held their breath waiting for
the story to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; resumed Ross, impressively, &#8220;I&#8217;d give my right
hand to know just what those things were.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hearers sat for a moment stunned and bewildered by this sudden
ending.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; gasped Teddy. &#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t
know what happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>know</i>. From what
I&#8217;ve been able to learn I can make a pretty good guess. All I <i>know</i>
is that my father was picked up a week later in an open boat, wounded and
starving and delirious.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gasp of wonder and pity ran around the little circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;From a letter found in his pocket they learned who he was, and after
he had partially recovered they sent him home to us,&#8221; Ross went on.
&#8220;But from then to the day of his death, which took place a year later, he
was insane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scoundrels!&#8221; muttered Fred, clenching his fists in
indignation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;We tried to
get at the facts by piecing together what he said when he was quieter than
usual,&#8221; Ross continued. &#8220;Again and again, he would speak of &#8216;the
lighthouse&#8217; and &#8216;Bartanet Shoals.&#8217; Then he would imagine himself in
a fight with the mate. Many times he spoke of &#8216;burying the box.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;All these of course were slight things to go on, but by putting them
all together and looking at them from every side, we figured out something like
this:</p>

<p>&#8220;The mate probably had his suspicions aroused by the weight of the box
that held the gold. Father must have come upon him when he was trying to open
it, and there was a fight in which the rest of the crew joined. They were
probably somewhere near Bartanet Shoals when this happened, and they put in at
some quiet place along here to think over what they&#8217;d better do. They
finally decided to bury the box and leave it there until the matter should have
blown over and been forgotten. The men probably intended to put father out of
the way, and, after the search for him had been given up, to come back and get
the box. Father either tried to escape in the open boat, or the crew, not quite
willing to kill him in cold blood, set him adrift, knowing that in his wounded
condition it would probably amount to the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the <i>Ranger</i> ever turn up?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at any of the home towns,&#8221; answered Ross. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> &#8220;But some months
later it was found tied up to a wharf near Halifax. It was from the log they
found on board that they learned of Captain Ramsay&#8217;s death. The crew were
traced, and it was found that they had shipped on a brig that was bound for the
Pacific. She went down in a storm off Cape Horn, and every soul on board was
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then everybody who was actually concerned in the matter is probably
dead,&#8221; mused Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ross, &#8220;we can&#8217;t look for any help
from human witnesses. There&#8217;s a bare chance that some letter or document
may turn up that will give us a clue. But that&#8217;s so unlikely that
it&#8217;s hardly worth considering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then all you have to go on is the possibility that the box was buried
somewhere on this coast not very far from Bartanet Shoals, and that if it was,
it&#8217;s never been taken away?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; admitted Ross,
&#8220;except&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He checked himself hastily.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AARON RUSHTON, CREDITOR</span></h2>

<p>If the other boys noticed the involuntary movement, they made no comment, and
Ross went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows may think I&#8217;m foolish to go on hunting for the gold
when I&#8217;ve got so little evidence to go on. It seems almost like hunting
for a needle in a haystack. But there&#8217;s such a lot at stake that I
can&#8217;t give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re foolish,&#8221; maintained Teddy
stoutly. &#8220;It&#8217;s just what I&#8217;d do, if I were in your
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; agreed Fred. &#8220;Of course you may never find
it. But if you didn&#8217;t try for it, you&#8217;d feel restless and uneasy all
the rest of your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to have tried and failed, than never to have tried
at all,&#8221; declared Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re young enough yet to spare a year or two more at it
anyway,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;If nothing comes of it, you can settle down
at something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ross, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t a matter of life and
death anyway. Mother is still keeping the old place up in Canada and looking
after the property that father left there. The income is small, but it is <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span> enough to keep us going,
and if I finally have to give up looking for the gold, I can go back there and
do pretty well. But it would take me a long time to get enough together to pay
father&#8217;s debts, and perhaps I could never do it. That&#8217;s the real
reason why I&#8217;m so anxious to find the chest. It isn&#8217;t so much for
what it would give me, though of course I&#8217;d be glad to have it. But I know
how father felt, and I feel that I owe it to his memory to carry out his wishes,
if I possibly can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the debts mount up to a very large amount?&#8221; Bill ventured to
ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Larger than I care to think of,&#8221; answered Ross. &#8220;I should
say that it would take about twenty thousand dollars if they were settled now.
And, of course, there&#8217;s the interest creeping up with every day that
passes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the creditors would be so glad to get back the principal, that
they wouldn&#8217;t worry much about the interest,&#8221; remarked Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they would,&#8221; answered Ross. &#8220;But they ought to
get both, and I shall never feel that I&#8217;m clear with the world until they
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear that the son had inherited to the full his father&#8217;s
independence of spirit, and the boys&#8217; liking for him deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the debts are for small amounts,&#8221; Ross continued, again
taking the little red memorandum book from his pocket, &#8220;that is,
comparatively small. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
There&#8217;s one big one that is more than all the rest put together. The
others are for a few hundred dollars each, though one or two of them run into
the thousands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned over the pages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father was very methodical and precise,&#8221; he went on, showing the
pages. &#8220;You see, he has all the names arranged in alphabetical order.
There&#8217;s Allen, three hundred and twenty-seven dollars; Carey, one hundred
and ninety-two; Linson, eighty-five; Masters, six hundred and eighteen. And here
we come to the big one, Rushton, twelve thousand four hundred
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; broke in Teddy excitedly. &#8220;Why
that&#8217;s my name and Fred&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; asked Ross in surprise, for so far he had heard the
boys speak to each other only by their first names, and there had been no formal
introduction. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t such a common name, either. Perhaps
it&#8217;s your father. What&#8217;s his first name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mansfield,&#8221; came simultaneously from both of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then he isn&#8217;t the one,&#8221; said Ross, consulting his
book. &#8220;This is&#8211;let me see,&#8221; as his finger sought the place,
&#8220;Aaron&#8211;Aaron Rushton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have an Uncle Aaron, my father&#8217;s brother,&#8221; stated
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it possibly be Uncle Aaron?&#8221; asked Teddy, his pulses
quickened by the possibility.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t be a bit surprised,&#8221; rejoined Ross. &#8220;There
can&#8217;t be so many Aaron Rushtons in this part of the country. This man
lived, at that time in Medford, not far from Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just where Uncle Aaron used to live!&#8221; broke in
Fred. &#8220;He has some property there yet, although lately he spends a good
deal of the time with us in Oldtown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you know his handwriting, if you saw it?&#8221; asked Ross,
feeling in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure we would!&#8221; answered Fred. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen it a
hundred times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a look at that then,&#8221; said Ross, taking a wrinkled sheet of
paper from a collection wrapped in oiled silk and held together by a rubber
band, &#8220;and see if it&#8217;s your uncle&#8217;s writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred unfolded the paper with hands that trembled with excitement, while Teddy
looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>It was a brief note, dated fifteen years before, acknowledging the receipt of
three hundred and sixty dollars, being the semi-annual interest on notes given
by Mr. Montgomery. It had been written from Medford, and it bore the stiff
precise signature of Aaron Rushton.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Uncle Aaron&#8217;s writing!&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; echoed Teddy. &#8220;I&#8217;d know it among a
thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Well, what
do you think of that?&#8221; chimed in Bill, as he and Lester crowded around to
look.</p>

<p>It gave the boys a queer thrill to think of all that had been pressed into
the years between the time that note was written and the present. It seemed like
a link between the living and the dead. The man who had received it was in his
grave, and the one who had sent it had long since given up all hope of hearing
of the matter again. And now chance had brought together the son of one and the
nephews of the other on this stormy night on the seacoast, and they sat tracing
out the faded lines by the flickering light of the brush fire.</p>

<p>Fred sat back and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember what Dave Parloe said&#8211;that it was a small world
after all?&#8221; he asked Bill. &#8220;I know now that he was right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that it was you who saved my life this afternoon, and that it
was your uncle who helped my father when he was in business trouble!&#8221;
exclaimed Ross. &#8220;I feel that I owe you more than ever now. You see, Mr.
Aaron Rushton lent part of the twelve thousand dollars to father when he started
into business in Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think of Uncle Aaron&#8217;s doing a thing like that!&#8221;
exclaimed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t owe me anything,&#8221; affirmed Fred, &#8220;and as
for what you owe Uncle Aaron, he&#8217;s stopped worrying over that long
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>&#8220;But
won&#8217;t he be surprised when we write and tell him all about this?&#8221;
demanded Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only pitch in and help Ross find the gold, we&#8217;d
square ourselves with Uncle Aaron for the rest of our lives,&#8221; remarked
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, has he anything against you now?&#8221; asked Ross, in
surprise.</p>

<p>Teddy&#8217;s eyes twinkled as he looked at Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;not especially. Down in his heart
I think he&#8217;s rather fond of us. But he&#8217;s a bachelor, and he
hasn&#8217;t much use for boys. I got in bad with him last year when I sent a
baseball against the horse of a coach he was riding in and made the team run
away. He jumped just as they got to a bridge and went head first into the river.
Do you remember how he looked, Fred, when he came up dripping?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I ever forget it?&#8221; chuckled Fred, as the picture of his
uncle, with his hair plastered over his face and the water streaming from his
bony frame, came up before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was furious,&#8221; explained Teddy, &#8220;and he was worse yet
when he found that he&#8217;d spoiled his watch and lost some valuable papers.
We got those back for him, though, and that made things better, though I
don&#8217;t think he approves of us yet. But if we could get this money for him,
he&#8217;d sure give us a clean bill of health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Aaron likes money, all right,&#8221; added <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span> Fred, &#8220;though I will say that when
he does spend, he does it royally. He certainly fixed us up in style when he
bought the tickets for us to go out to Bill&#8217;s ranch. He&#8217;s got a
hair-trigger temper, but take him all in all, he&#8217;s a good old
chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he must be, from what mother has told me,&#8221; said Ross.
&#8220;He might have seized what property we&#8217;ve got in payment of the
debt, but when he learned that father had died and that mother had just enough
to get along on, he did not trouble us. And that&#8217;s one thing that makes me
all the more eager to pay what father owed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what we fellows ought to do!&#8221; exclaimed Fred.
&#8220;We ought to spend the rest of our vacation here helping Ross look for the
gold. There&#8217;ll be lots of fun and excitement in it anyway, even if we
never lay eyes on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And think what it would mean if we did really find it,&#8221; gloated
Teddy. &#8220;Think what Uncle Aaron would say, and how proud father and mother
would be if we had a hand in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To say nothing of how Ross would feel, if we got back his
father&#8217;s money,&#8221; added Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea looks good to me,&#8221; declared Lester. &#8220;I have the
<i>Ariel</i>, and if we can get the motor boat back for Ross, there won&#8217;t
be a spot on the coast within fifty miles that we can&#8217;t explore. Between
us, we may run across some clue, and even if we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll get
lots of fun out of the hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;Like the
old darky with his lottery ticket,&#8221; laughed Bill. &#8220;His boss reproved
him for spending money on a mere chance. &#8216;Oh, I dunno, boss,&#8217; the old
fellow answered. &#8216;T&#8217;ree dollars ain&#8217;t much to spend fur a whole
year&#8217;s hopin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty good of you fellows to help me out this way,&#8221;
said Ross gratefully, when the laugh had subsided. &#8220;Of course, if you do
find it, there&#8217;ll be a great big reward in it for you. I know that
isn&#8217;t what you are looking for, but you&#8217;ll get it just the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave that all to you,&#8221; answered Lester.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to find it first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the old English recipe for cooking rabbit that begins: &#8216;First
catch the hare,&#8217;&#8221; chuckled Fred.</p>

<p>The lads sat about the fire for another hour, too excited by all that had
happened to think of sleep. Then Lester gave the signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have plenty of time to
talk this over, but now we must get some rest. I want to get an early start in
the morning, if the storm has blown over. It&#8217;s me for the downy couch now
and the early bird stunt in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;downy couch&#8221; resolved itself into beds hollowed out in the
sand with the boys&#8217; coats rolled up for pillows. But no king in his bed of
state ever enjoyed a sounder sleep than that into which the tired boys fell at
once, while the fire died down and the surf beat on the rocks outside.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DRIFTING MOTOR BOAT</span></h2>

<p>The sun had not yet risen the next morning, although the eastern sky was
bright with signs of coming dawn, when Lester passed among his sleeping comrades
with a shake on the shoulder for each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, you sleepy heads,&#8221; he cried, as they sat up and
rubbed their eyes. &#8220;We must hustle now and get off. Lively&#8217;s the
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You old tyrant,&#8221; yawned Teddy. &#8220;I feel as though I&#8217;d
just got to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that I smell?&#8221; demanded Fred, as a savory whiff
came to his nostrils. &#8220;Is it coffee, or does my nose deceive
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a deceive,&#8221; grinned Lester. &#8220;I just remembered that
we had some coffee in the locker, and I swam out and got it. And that
isn&#8217;t all. Just take a sniff of this,&#8221; and he motioned to an old can
that he had rummaged from the hut, and that hung by two forked sticks over the
fire, giving off a most appetizing odor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clams,&#8221; pronounced Fred, as he bent over it. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span> &#8220;Lester,
you&#8217;re a wonder. Where did you get them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found a bed of them up the cove a bit,&#8221; answered Lester.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m some little hustler, if any one should ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys needed no further urging, and after plunging their faces into the
waters of the cove, they ranged themselves round the fire and sampled
Lester&#8217;s cooking. The clams were delicious as a beginning, and, topped off
with the bacon and the rest of the bluefish, together with the fragrant coffee,
furnished a meal that would have made a dyspeptic green with envy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, fellows,&#8221; said Lester, when the last crumb and last drop
had vanished, &#8220;the storm has gone down, although the water&#8217;s still
pretty rough. But we can start all right. I&#8217;ll swim out to the
<i>Ariel</i>, get up the anchor, and bring her in far enough so you can wade out
to her and get aboard. Then we&#8217;ll make a break for open water and take a
look around for Ross&#8217; motor boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m none too sure we&#8217;ll find her,&#8221; said Ross,
dubiously. &#8220;She may have been swamped or dashed against the
rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; remarked Fred. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
wonder what a boat will go through sometimes, and then she was so far out that I
don&#8217;t think she got near the rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if we don&#8217;t find her, it won&#8217;t be any proof <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> that she went
under,&#8221; added Teddy. &#8220;Some other boat may have caught sight of her
and taken her in tow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in such a blow as we had last night, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
answered Ross. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;m not going to begin to grizzle now.
There&#8217;ll be plenty of time to do that if we don&#8217;t find
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were all on board, and the <i>Ariel</i> made for the
narrow passage between the sentinel rocks at the mouth of the cove.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little different from what it was when we came scooting in last
night,&#8221; remarked Teddy, as the sturdy little boat danced out on the waves
that sparkled in the sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, rather!&#8221; answered Lester, as he swung the <i>Ariel</i>
round to her course. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you fellows now that I
felt mighty shaky yesterday afternoon. I&#8217;ve been out in many a stiff blow,
but I&#8217;ve usually had warning and been able to make a dash for home. It
takes pretty careful work to get a boat into that cove between those two big
rocks even in ordinary weather; but it&#8217;s a case of nip and tuck when one
has to try it in a storm. My heart was in my mouth for a few minutes until we
got safely through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t show it,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;You went at it as
coolly as any old salt who has done nothing else all his life but buck the
seas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, we got through all right, and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> that&#8217;s all that counts,&#8221;
returned Lester. &#8220;But after this I&#8217;m going to keep my eyes peeled
for signs of trouble before the trouble comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was our fault for talking too much,&#8221; remarked Teddy.
&#8220;We were so stirred up by that letter from Mel that we couldn&#8217;t
think of anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Lester had the boat well out on the open sea, and every one kept
a sharp lookout for any trace of Ross&#8217; boat. In his heart no one of them
really expected to see it again, but they all kept up an appearance of
confidence, the Rally Hall boys doing so in order not to discourage their
new-found friend.</p>

<p>He, on his part, was almost silent. This was due to some extent, no doubt, to
the reaction from his severe ordeal of the day before, but it may have been
caused somewhat by the feeling that he had gone too far in taking them fully
into his confidence. His secret was no longer his, and while he was strongly
drawn toward these wholesome young fellows who were of his own age, he could not
help feeling a little uneasy. He felt sure that they would act toward him in
perfect good faith, but some careless or indiscreet word dropped by any one of
them might betray the secret to others who would not be as scrupulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had brought a pair of glasses along,&#8221; remarked Lester.
&#8220;There&#8217;s an extra pair at the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_53'></a>53</span> lighthouse, and we might have had it as well as
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Teddy, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got Bill&#8217;s
eyes to fall back on, and if they can see as far out over the water as they used
to over the prairie, they&#8217;ll be almost as good as glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over an hour elapsed without any trace of the derelict, and Lester began to
feel uneasy in regard to his long absence from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to cut this short,&#8221; he said reluctantly, &#8220;but I
know just how father is feeling after yesterday&#8217;s storm, and I feel
it&#8217;s up to me to let him know we&#8217;re safe. As soon as we&#8217;ve
done that, we can put right out again and spend the whole day looking for the
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just right,&#8221; answered Ross heartily. &#8220;You
fellows have done enough for me already and you ought to make a bee-line for
home. The chances are all against our finding the motor boat anyway. It may have
sunk long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as Lester was about to act on the suggestion, there was a cry from
Bill:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something over there that may be what we&#8217;re after.
I&#8217;ve been watching it for some minutes. It&#8217;s a boat of some kind,
and it hasn&#8217;t any sails. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere, but
is just tossing up and down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest strained their eyes, but at first could see only a tiny dot. Lester
steered straight toward the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_54'></a>54</span> object and as a stiff breeze filled the sail he made
rapid progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; shouted Ross jubilantly, as they came closer;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve handled it too long to be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a forlorn hope
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re some little searchers, all right,&#8221; exulted Bill.</p>

<p>They were soon within a hundred feet of the motor boat. It was a trim,
smart-looking little craft, and the boys admired the long sloping lines that
denoted speed. There was no sign of any damage to the boat, but the loggy way in
which it moved showed that it had shipped a lot of water.</p>

<p>With a skilful twist of the tiller, Lester rounded to on the port side. Fred
reached out and held the two boats together with the hook, while the others let
the fenders over the side to keep the boats from scraping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right as a trivet,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;Here&#8217;s your boat,
Ross, old man, and as far as I can see it&#8217;s just as good as
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget you fellows as long as I live!&#8221;
exclaimed Ross gratefully, as he leaped to the deck of his own craft.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SLENDER CHANCE</span></h2>

<p>Ross was quickly followed by Bill and Teddy. Lester and Fred waited only
until they had fastened the two boats securely together, then they followed the
example of their mates.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t full of water or anything like that, is she?&#8221;
remarked Teddy, as he saw the water sloshing from one side to the other as the
boat rocked on the waves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two feet at least,&#8221; judged Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than eighteen inches,&#8221; was the verdict of Lester, who
was accustomed to measure depths where water was concerned. &#8220;But
that&#8217;s enough and more than enough. She&#8217;s a pretty good seaworthy
boat, or she&#8217;d have shipped a good deal more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have ridden the waves like a cork,&#8221; said Fred in
admiration.</p>

<p>The motor boat was not quite as large as the <i>Ariel</i>, being perhaps two
feet shorter, and also narrower in the beam. In the stern there was a gasoline
engine of the newest type, bearing the name of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_56'></a>56</span> a celebrated maker. Amidships, there was a tiny cabin
that one had to stoop to enter. On one side of this were small lockers, one
designed to hold tools and spare parts of the engine, the other serving as a
pantry. On the other side was a low, broad seat extending the whole length of
the cabin, and on this was a cushion which at night served as a mattress for the
owner of the boat.</p>

<p>Everything about the little craft was trim and plain, the only ornament in
sight being some brass work that surrounded the binnacle. It was clear that it
had been built with an eye to usefulness rather than beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing now, fellows,&#8221; said Lester, after a quick glance
around had satisfied his curiosity, &#8220;is to get the water over into the sea
where it belongs. We&#8217;d better get off our shoes and socks and roll our
trousers up high.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a twinkling, the boys were ready for wading.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a bailer here,&#8221; said Ross, producing it from the
locker.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right but it isn&#8217;t enough,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get Lester&#8217;s, and you fellows can rustle up something
else that will do the trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were rather restricted in their choice, but the articles they
finally got together for the purpose served well enough. As Teddy put it, the
collection was &#8220;neat but not gaudy.&#8221; He had the frying pan, Bill
handled the coffee pot, Lester used <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> a huge sponge, while Fred and Ross did effective work
with the bailers.</p>

<p>Before the onslaught of five sturdy pairs of arms, the water went down
quickly and was soon so low that only the sponge could be used. Five minutes
more, and the last drop had been squeezed over the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Lester, as he flung the sponge back into the
<i>Ariel</i>. &#8220;She&#8217;s empty now and the hot sun will soon dry out the
planks. But I wouldn&#8217;t advise you to sleep on those cushions to-night,
unless you want to get rheumatism or pneumonia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to,&#8221; answered Ross. &#8220;As soon as I get
the engine going, I&#8217;ll beat it to Oakland, and I&#8217;ll sleep between
sheets to-night in a regular bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be a bad place, either, after last night on the
sand,&#8221; replied Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying at Oakland right along, when you&#8217;re not cruising
around?&#8221; asked Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been there for the last two months. I have relatives
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s nothing special to call you there now, I&#8217;d be
glad to have you come along with us to Bartanet Shoals,&#8221; said Lester
hospitably.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be great!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;Then we could talk
more about the missing money. There&#8217;ll be a hundred things come up that
we&#8217;ll want to ask you about.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s
very kind of you,&#8221; responded Ross warmly, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like
nothing better. But just now I&#8217;m looking for my mother to come down from
her home in Canada. She may be here any time now, and I want to be on hand when
she comes. She&#8217;s going to stay for several weeks. But the very first
chance I get, I&#8217;ll come over to the Shoals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;The latch string hangs outside
the door, and we&#8217;ll be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the engine?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right as can be, as far as I can see,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to dry it and polish it. There wasn&#8217;t anything
serious the matter with it yesterday&#8211;just a little trouble with the
ignition&#8211;and I was just getting it into shape, when that big wave came
aboard and took me over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stand by anyway for a few minutes to make sure,&#8221;
said Lester, as he rose to return to the <i>Ariel</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait another minute,&#8221; urged Ross earnestly.
&#8220;You fellows have done enough for me already, and I know you&#8217;re just
aching to get home to relieve your father&#8217;s mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cast off anyway,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
take a little time to run up the sheet and get ready to sail, and by that time
you&#8217;ll know better how things are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call your boat, Ross?&#8221; asked <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span> Teddy, as the rest of the boys rose to
follow Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve named her the <i>Sleuth</i>,&#8221; answered Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty suitable name, considering what you&#8217;re using
her for,&#8221; laughed Teddy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hope she&#8217;ll be sleuth
enough to get on the trail of the smugglers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will,&#8221; said Ross with decision; and a look of determination
leaped into his eyes, while his lips compressed themselves into a straight
line.</p>

<p>His chums drew in the fenders and ran up the sail, while Lester took his
place at the tiller and eased the <i>Ariel</i> off, until a space of twenty feet
separated the two boats.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run a few rings around you, while you get the engine to
working,&#8221; called out Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, if you insist upon it,&#8221; laughed Ross.
&#8220;That&#8217;s easy enough to do now, but some day we&#8217;ll have a race,
and then it may be a little tougher job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it comes now!&#8221; he exclaimed a moment later, as the engine
gave a few preliminary barks.</p>

<p>The sparking was fitful at first, but it soon settled down into a smooth
steady buzz.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to that music,&#8221; cried Ross jubilantly. &#8220;Richard is
himself again!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started the boat, and she darted ahead like a bird. He tested the steering
gear and it worked perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; cried Fred delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; echoed Teddy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s
a pippin!&#8221; exclaimed Bill enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Ross flushed with pleasure at the praise of his craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he called, &#8220;I owe it all to you fellows that
I&#8217;m on board of her to-day. I hope you&#8217;ll never get into similar
trouble, but if you do, I only hope that I&#8217;m on hand to help you
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their courses lay in opposite directions and amid a chorus of good wishes and
hand wavings they rapidly drew apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; remarked Teddy, drawing a long breath when they were out
of ear shot, &#8220;this has been an adventure with a great big A.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d ever have thought when we started out yesterday that
we&#8217;d run across anything like this?&#8221; added Fred, as he settled down
with his hand on the sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the beauty of the sea,&#8221; remarked Lester, as he
brought his boat up a little more into the wind. &#8220;On the land, things jog
along steadily and there aren&#8217;t so many surprises. But at sea, anything
can happen. You never know what&#8217;s going to turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; replied Bill, moved to a defence
of his beloved prairies. &#8220;Plenty of unexpected things turn up on land too.
I guess Fred and Teddy didn&#8217;t find things very tame out at the ranch this
summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We surely did not!&#8221; returned Fred. &#8220;What with ghosts and
rattlesnakes and bears and cattle <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_61'></a>61</span> rustlers, we didn&#8217;t find time hanging heavy on
our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so that you could notice it,&#8221; chuckled Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there are exceptions,&#8221; admitted Lester, &#8220;but I
was speaking in a general way. My father was a sailor and the sea is in my
blood. I never get tired of it and I&#8217;m always finding in it something new
and exciting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like our new friend?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Teddy promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All to the good,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s verdict.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to be the real thing,&#8221; agreed Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly had hard luck,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;If his
father had been able to carry through his plans, life would be a mighty
different thing to Ross from what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be an awful strain on a fellow to be on a still hunt like
his,&#8221; mused Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and with so little to work on,&#8221; chimed in Teddy. &#8220;If
he had anything definite to go on, like a map or a letter or a confession, it
would be another thing. But he seems to be relying altogether on chance and the
ravings of his father. And a crazy man may say anything. What does his speaking
about Bartanet Shoals mean? It might have been just chance that he didn&#8217;t
mention Cape Horn or Baffin Bay or any other place.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;Do you
think,&#8221; asked Lester slowly, &#8220;that Ross has told us everything he
knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>The others looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what makes you ask that?&#8221; inquired Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just how much there is to it,&#8221; was the
answer; &#8220;but did you notice how he checked himself last night, when some
one asked him whether those were all the clues he had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you speak of it, I do remember that he said he hadn&#8217;t
anything else, and then he used the word &#8216;except,&#8217;&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;Then he stopped suddenly and didn&#8217;t explain what that
&#8216;except&#8217; meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He acted as though something had slipped out before he thought,&#8221;
volunteered Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hardly blame him, if he felt a little doubtful about
us,&#8221; observed Teddy. &#8220;He had never seen us before, and I think he
went pretty far in telling us even as much as he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;How did he know
that we wouldn&#8217;t blurt out the whole thing to any one who would listen. It
might spoil all his chances of recovering anything. There are plenty of fellows
who would spy on his every act and make life a burden to him. Others might plan
to follow him and take the gold away from him by force if he should find
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a big temptation,&#8221; agreed Bill. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span> &#8220;There are some fellows who would
sell their souls for a ten dollar bill. How much more, if the reward were a
chest of gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame Ross a bit under the circumstances,&#8221; said
Fred, &#8220;but I&#8217;m sorry just the same. We have so little to go by that
we can&#8217;t afford to lose the slightest thing that may help us
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see him again before long anyway,&#8221; put in Teddy
hopefully, &#8220;and he may grow to know us well enough to put us wise to all
that he&#8217;s been keeping back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll live in hopes,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;But look over
there, boys, and see a sight to gladden your eyes. We are almost
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed his gaze and saw the Bartanet Shoals Lighthouse, its great
reflector sparkling in the rays of the morning sun.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BEACON LIGHT</span></h2>

<p>The lighthouse was a massive structure, over a hundred feet in height. It had
been built in obedience to a general demand, owing to the number of vessels that
had been wrecked in the vicinity. There were treacherous currents and swiftly
running tides due to the peculiar conformation of the Maine coast at that point,
and if a ship once grounded on the shoals while a storm was raging its hours
were numbered.</p>

<p>In the distance, with the sun playing on it and the sea gulls swooping about
its top, it seemed something slender and ethereal. It was only when one was
close at hand that its real strength and solidity could be appreciated.</p>

<p>It was built on a solid rock foundation that sloped down into the sea many
feet distant from its base. The tower was circular in form so as to offer as
little surface as possible to the wind from whatever quarter it might blow. The
walls at the bottom, where the force of the waves spent itself, were many feet
thick, but they grew thinner as the tower rose in the air. At the top was the
enormous light <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> of
many thousand candle power. It was the alternating kind, and every fifteen
seconds it threw out a ray that could be seen by mariners for many miles.</p>

<p>The lighthouse stood about a mile from the mainland, and all the household
supplies had to be brought over by Lester or his father from the little village
of Bartanet. Whatever was needed for the light itself came at stated intervals
on the government cutters that cruised along that section of the coast.</p>

<p>The boys, under Lester&#8217;s guidance, had long before this explored every
portion of the lighthouse and wondered at the marvels of the machinery that set
the light in motion and kept it going automatically through the night. Brought
up in inland towns, all this was new to them, and their curiosity and interest
were insatiable.</p>

<p>Now as they watched it growing larger as they drew nearer, they shared the
delight and pride of Lester in the noble structure of which his father was the
guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it glorious?&#8221; demanded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the lives that have been saved by it,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will be saved by it during the next hundred years,&#8221; added
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if poor Mr. Montgomery saw it on that last cruise of
his,&#8221; pondered Fred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;He must
have, if the smugglers really came this way,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;That
was only about nine years ago, you remember Ross said, and the lighthouse has
stood for twenty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your father had charge of it all that time?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he was appointed about twelve years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he must have been here at the time the gold was stolen,&#8221;
said Teddy eagerly. &#8220;I wonder if he heard anything about the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard him speak about it, but I shouldn&#8217;t be a bit
surprised if he had. There are so many old salts that run over to spin yarns
with him, that there&#8217;s very little sea gossip going around that he
doesn&#8217;t hear at one time or another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask him,&#8221; suggested Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely we will. He may be able to tell us something that Ross himself
doesn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case, the next time we meet Ross it will be our turn to look
wise and mysterious,&#8221; laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or we can bargain with him. We&#8217;ll tell him what we know in
return for what he was going to tell us but didn&#8217;t,&#8221; added his
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to come to something like that sooner or
later,&#8221; said Lester decidedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s all nonsense our going
round blindly, when each might be able to help the other. A sick man ought to
tell everything to his doctor, and a prisoner oughtn&#8217;t to keep <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span> anything back from his
lawyer. When he does, he has no one to blame but himself if things don&#8217;t
go right. I&#8217;m going to put it up to Ross, full and plain, the next time I
see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder when that will be,&#8221; murmured Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before long I hope. If he doesn&#8217;t come over to see us,
we&#8217;ll go up to Oakland to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is Oakland from here?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than thirty miles. With a good wind we can make it in a few
hours. But I think I see father standing on the platform of the tower. Take a
look, Bill, and tell me if it is. My eyes are pretty good, but yours are
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who it is,&#8221; pronounced Bill, after a minute&#8217;s
scrutiny. &#8220;He has a pair of glasses in his hands. There, he&#8217;s waving
to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old dad!&#8221; exclaimed Lester. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s
worried himself half sick, wondering what had become of us. But he knows now
that we are safe, and with this wind we&#8217;ll not be more than twenty minutes
or half an hour in getting in.&#8221;</p>

<p>They flew along over the waves, cunningly coaxing every inch of speed out of
the <i>Ariel</i>, and in less time than Lester had predicted they rounded to at
the little dock on the leeward side of the lighthouse rock. A bronzed, elderly
man, of medium height, came hurriedly down to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, you are safe!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he grasped
Lester&#8217;s hand, then that of each of the boys <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span> in turn. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able
to think of anything but you all night long. What happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, Dad,&#8221; said Lester, beaming
affectionately on his father, as, after fastening the <i>Ariel</i>, they all
walked up to the lighthouse. &#8220;We picked up a fellow that had been carried
overboard from his motor boat, and by that time the storm had grown so bad that
we had to run for it to the nearest place that offered us shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up in Sentinel Cove. You know, where those two big rocks stand at the
entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you took the boat through that entrance while
that storm was raging?&#8221; asked his father, in a tone in which surprise and
pride were equally blended.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t anything else to do,&#8221; answered Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have seen the way he shot through there, Mr. Lee,&#8221;
put in Fred. &#8220;It was a fine bit of seamanship. He&#8217;s your own son
when it comes to sailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t see him,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;It would have made my hair grayer than it is, and that&#8217;s gray
enough. But all&#8217;s well that ends well, and I needn&#8217;t tell you how
thankful I am to have you turn up safe and sound. It wasn&#8217;t only my own
boy, but I feel that I&#8217;m responsible for you young chaps, too, while
you&#8217;re visiting here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>The boys had grown
very fond of this kindly, hearty man who was their friend&#8217;s father. He had
made them instantly welcome and given them the run of the place. His means were
limited but his heart was big, and from the outset he had spared no pains to
make them feel at home and to give them a good time.</p>

<p>There were no women on the little island, as Lester&#8217;s mother had died
ten years before. Because of this, the father and son, having no one but each
other, were bound together by the strongest affection.</p>

<p>Their housekeeping was of the simplest kind, but both of them were prime
cooks and they set such an abundant table that even the boys with their ravenous
appetites were completely satisfied. They even found a certain pleasure in the
lack of some of the &#8220;trimmings,&#8221; as Teddy called them, that had
surrounded them in their more elaborate homes. It gave them a sense of freedom,
and the whole adventure became a sort of exalted camping out.</p>

<p>Bill&#8217;s life and Fred&#8217;s and Teddy&#8217;s recent experiences in
the West had hardened and toughened them and also made them more self-reliant.
The breezy outdoor life had become almost a necessity to them. So they entered
heartily into the domestic arrangements at Bartanet Shoals, making their own
beds and helping to prepare the meals. It is probable that some of their women
relatives would have <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
sniffed contemptuously at some of the results they reached, but this bothered
them not at all. They ate like wolves, slept like logs and were content.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee had followed the sea for many years. When scarcely out of his teens,
he had entered the navy. Later, he had shipped as a whaler, and the boys
listened breathlessly to the thrilling stories he had to tell of his adventures
in that perilous calling. After his wife&#8217;s death, he felt that the
interests of his son required that he should stay at home; so he had applied for
the position of lighthouse keeper at Bartanet Shoals, and had received it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys must be half starved,&#8221; he said, as they entered the
living room of the lighthouse. &#8220;As I remember, you didn&#8217;t have
anything when you started out except a few slices of bacon, and those
wouldn&#8217;t go far with such a hungry crew as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess again, Dad,&#8221; laughed Lester. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t
exactly starve last night and this morning, did we, boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-yum,&#8221; assented Fred, &#8220;I should say not! Clam soup and
fried bacon and broiled bluefish and hot coffee! Nothing more than that. And we
didn&#8217;t do a thing to them, eh, fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing!&#8221; chorused Bill and Teddy fervently.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve made an awful mistake then,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> he said soberly. &#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d be nearly famished, and so I spread myself in getting up an
extra good dinner. But of course, if you&#8217;ve had so many good things, you
won&#8217;t want anything more and I&#8217;ll have to eat all alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw open the dining-room door and savory odors issued forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead me to it!&#8221; shouted Bill. The next moment there was a
regular football rush, as the four laughing boys tried to beat each other to the
table.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CASTAWAY</span></h2>

<p>For the next few minutes there was not much talking, and the boys devoted
themselves to making a wreck of the good things heaped before them. Their
morning in the salt air on the open sea had put them in fine fettle and they had
enormous appetites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fred, when at last they were satisfied, &#8220;we
have to hand it to you as a cook, Mr. Lee. You certainly know how to make things
taste good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester comes rightly by his talent in fixing up the eats,&#8221;
declared Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sailor has to learn to turn his hand to anything,&#8221; laughed
their host. &#8220;He gets into lots of places where he has to depend on himself
alone or go hungry. I&#8217;ve been shipwrecked twice in the course of my life,
and I&#8217;ve had to learn to eat all sorts of things and to cook them in a way
that would help me get them down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about shipwrecks,&#8221; he went on, as he filled and lighted
his pipe and settled down for an after-dinner smoke, &#8220;reminds me of the
fellow you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span> say you
picked up yesterday. How did he come there? Go ahead and spin your
yarn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t exactly a shipwreck,&#8221; explained Lester.
&#8220;The boat wasn&#8217;t smashed, and as a matter of fact we found it for
Ross again to-day. It was a motor boat&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A motor boat!&#8221; interrupted Mr. Lee, with a sniff. He had the
distrust felt by most deep-water sailors, of what he called &#8220;these pesky
modern contraptions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ross was tinkering with some part of the machinery that had gone
wrong,&#8221; continued Lester, &#8220;when a big wave caught him and carried
him overboard. We were near by at the time and we made for him and got
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yanked him in with a boathook, I suppose,&#8221; said his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were too late for that,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;He had gone
down, but Fred grabbed a rope and dived over after him. It was a close call, but
he got him, and then we dragged them both in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A plucky thing to do in a storm like that,&#8221; commented Mr. Lee,
looking approvingly at Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ross came to after a while, and we found that the only hurt he had was
the water he had swallowed,&#8221; went on Lester. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t do
anything with the motor boat just then, so we made straight for Sentinel Cove.
This morning, Montgomery was as good as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>Mr. Lee started
slightly as he heard this name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montgomery, did you say?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I thought you called
him Ross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Ross Montgomery. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Go ahead with your
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t very much more to tell, as far as we&#8217;re
concerned. We anchored at the cove for the night, and got away bright and early
this morning. But Ross himself had a story to tell that has got us all worked
up. You&#8217;d never guess what it was, Dad, in a thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never was much good at guessing,&#8221; smiled Mr. Lee, &#8220;so
let&#8217;s have it just as he told it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lester started at the beginning and told the story as he had received it from
Ross, with frequent suggestions from the other boys to remind him of some slight
detail he had overlooked.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee listened intently, but he asked no questions, and for some minutes
after Lester had finished he continued to smoke in silence, while the boys
looked at him eagerly, anxious to know what he made of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dad,&#8221; said Lester, a little impatiently, &#8220;what do
you think of the story? Is there anything in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great deal in it,&#8221; replied Mr. Lee gravely,
removing his pipe from his mouth. &#8220;I believe every word of it is
true.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>The boys were
delighted at this confirmation of their own feeling by a mind more mature than
theirs. They had been afraid that Mr. Lee would ridicule the story, or throw
cold water on their plan to go ahead and try to find the treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was perfectly sure that Ross was telling us the truth,&#8221;
jubilated Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never doubted that for a minute,&#8221; put in Bill, &#8220;but I
thought he might be building hope on a very slight foundation. After all, he has
so little to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you really think that there was a chest of gold and that
smugglers took it from Mr. Montgomery and buried it?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they took it from him, but I don&#8217;t think they buried
it,&#8221; answered Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think they did with it; spent it?&#8221; asked Teddy in
quick alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that either,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I think
they hid it somewhere and that it&#8217;s there yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Fred, with a sigh of relief. &#8220;Then we still have
a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Dad!&#8221; exclaimed Lester, &#8220;I can see by what
you&#8217;re saying that you know more about this thing than we do. Don&#8217;t
tease us by acting in such a mysterious way. Come right out with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys are always in a hurry,&#8221; he remarked as he refilled his
pipe with a deliberation that was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_76'></a>76</span> maddening to his hearers. &#8220;But just let me get
my pipe drawing well, and I&#8217;ll tell you all I know. It isn&#8217;t so much
after all as maybe you think, but it may help to piece out a bit here and
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He settled himself comfortably in his seat and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about nine or ten years ago&#8211;I don&#8217;t remember the
exact date&#8211;that Mark Taylor was out fishing at a point about twenty miles
from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Mark Taylor who lives in Milton?&#8221; inquired Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the one. He wasn&#8217;t having very good luck, and had about
made up his mind to pull up and go home, when he caught sight of a little boat
tossing up and down on the waves. It didn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere, and
Mark could see that there was no one rowing or steering it. He thought that was
strange and made up his mind he&#8217;d look into the matter. So he ran up his
sail and ran over to what he thought was the empty boat. He told me afterwards
he was knocked all in a heap, when he saw a man lying in the bottom of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first Mark thought the man was either dead or drunk. But there
wasn&#8217;t any smell of liquor on him, and he moved when Mark touched him.
Mark saw that something serious was the matter, and he tried to get the man into
his sailboat. But Mark didn&#8217;t weigh more than a hundred and twenty <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> pounds, and this man was
so big and so heavily built that he had to give it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, leaving the man in it, he tied the small boat to the stern of his,
and made a quick run for home. He took the man into his cabin and sent for the
doctor. The doctor examined the man carefully and found a big gash in his head
that looked as though it had been made with a hatchet. He saw it hadn&#8217;t
reached a vital point, though, so he sewed it up and left some medicine,
promising to come again the next day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark said that the doctor had no sooner gone than the man began to
rave and toss about. After a while he became violent, and Mark, being a small
man as I have said, had to call in some of the neighbors to hold him down. He
seemed to imagine that he was in a fight and that a crowd was piling on him. And
he kept talking about &#8216;the gold&#8217; and &#8216;the chest,&#8217; and vowing that
they would never get it away from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur ran around the listening circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark didn&#8217;t pay much attention to what he said,&#8221; resumed
Mr. Lee, &#8220;because he thought it was only the raving of a crazy man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark and the neighbors searched his clothes and found some papers that
showed them the man&#8217;s name was Montgomery. They found out, too, that he
lived in a place on the coast of Canada. They wrote to his folks right away, and
a couple of men <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> came
down to take him home as soon as he was able to travel.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t for a good while, though, for Montgomery had come
down with an attack of brain fever that kept him on his back for weeks. He got
over that at last, but his mind wasn&#8217;t right. He wasn&#8217;t violent any
longer but was melancholy. Went around all the time in a daze. Couldn&#8217;t
get anything out of him, except that he kept muttering to himself about &#8216;the
gold.&#8217; Sometimes, though, he&#8217;d speak of debts that seemed to worry
him. He couldn&#8217;t carry on any connected conversation, and he&#8217;d get
so excited when any one tried to question him, that the doctor said they must
let him alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was taken away as soon as he was strong enough, and that&#8217;s
the last Mark ever saw of him. A little while later, the man&#8217;s wife sent a
little money to Mark to cover his expenses in caring for her husband, and she
said in her letter that he was no better. And from what you boys tell me to-day,
he must have died soon after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he give any hint of where this fight and robbery had
taken place?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, except that Mark says the man often spoke of Bartanet Shoals. Of
course, that may have meant something and it may have meant nothing. Still,
judging from where the boat was found, it probably was somewhere within fifty
miles of here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>&#8220;Fifty
miles,&#8221; murmured Bill. &#8220;That&#8217;s an awful lot of territory to
cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there anything in the little boat to give a clue?&#8221;
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing except that it had the name &#8217;<i>Ranger</i>&#8217;
painted on the stern. That showed that it must have come from a large boat of
that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that Mark didn&#8217;t tell you anything else that might
give us a hint?&#8221; asked Lester. &#8220;Try to remember, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; mused his father, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t question him very
much at the time, because I felt as he did, that it was just the foolish raving
of a man who was out of his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is Milton from here?&#8221; questioned Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a matter of twenty-five miles or so,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go over and see Mark the first chance we get,&#8221; said
Lester decidedly. &#8220;He may drop something when we put him through the third
degree that may put us on the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; commented his father.
&#8220;Mark&#8217;s growing pretty old now and his memory isn&#8217;t as good as
it was, but he may remember something that will be of use. At any rate
there&#8217;s no harm in trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have something to work with now,&#8221; said Fred cheerily.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to check up Ross&#8217; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> story and know that he wasn&#8217;t
dreaming. Then, too, we have the name of the man who actually found Mr.
Montgomery when he was set adrift, if that&#8217;s the way he came into the open
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there must be more,&#8221; persisted Lester. &#8220;What did you
mean, Dad, when you said that the gold wasn&#8217;t buried but that it was
hidden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; admitted his father, &#8220;there is more
that happened some time later.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SMUGGLERS&#8217; FLIGHT</span></h2>

<p>The boys were all on edge as they awaited further developments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six years ago,&#8221; resumed Mr. Lee, &#8220;an old sailor, named Tom
Bixby, who had sailed on the same ship with me in the old days, drifted down
this way, and hearing that I had charge of the lighthouse came over to see me.
Tom was always a decent sort of fellow, and I was glad to see him and talk over
the old times when we had sailed the seas together.</p>

<p>&#8220;He stayed here a couple of days and one night he told me a strange
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that his last trip had been on a four-master sailing out of
Halifax. She had been rather short-handed, and the skipper had been worrying
about where he could get enough sailors to work his craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;While he was casting around, he was surprised and glad one day to have
half a dozen burly fellows come aboard and offer to sign articles for the
voyage. They told a story of just having finished <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> a trip on a tramp from Liverpool, and as
they were all messmates they were anxious to get a berth together on the same
ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain didn&#8217;t ask any question&#8211;no captain ever does
when he happens to be short-handed&#8211;and he signed the men on at once. That
very night the ship hove her anchor and put out to sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were to go around Cape Horn, and it would be at least two years
and maybe more before they would see home again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom said that the men were good, smart sailors and no mistake. But
there was something queer about them. They didn&#8217;t mix much with the others
of the crew. They would gather together in a little knot when they were off duty
and talk in whispers. It seemed as though some secret held them together.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who seemed to be most influential among them was a big
Portuguese named Manuel. The others seemed to stand in fear of him. He
didn&#8217;t seem like a common sailor, but acted as if he were used to giving
orders instead of obeying them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom said that at last he got rather chummy with one of them, named
Dick, and used to have long talks with him. From what the man let slip, Tom
learned that he had passed most of his life in the coastwise trade, and though
he didn&#8217;t say right out that he had been a smuggler, Tom guessed as
much.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;One night
Dick, while reefing sails in a blow, had a bad fall from aloft. He was a very
sick man for a while, and the skipper didn&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;d pull
through or not. The captain detailed Tom to look after him, and in that way they
got more confidential than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day Dick had a turn for the worse and thought he was going to die.
He was dreadfully scared and after a good deal of beating around the bush, told
Tom that he wanted to get something off his mind. He didn&#8217;t want to die,
he said, without having made a clean breast of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he went on to say that he had been a seaman on board a coastwise
trader called the <i>Ranger</i> that hailed from some Canadian port not far from
Halifax. She did a good deal of legitimate trading, but mixed in with this a
considerable amount of smuggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her captain was a man named Ramsay&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very name Ross gave us,&#8221; broke in Teddy
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a hard man, but, outside the smuggling, a straight one,&#8221;
resumed Mr. Lee, &#8220;and the people along the coast had confidence in
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day a man, whose name Dick didn&#8217;t remember, came aboard for
a trip to the New England coast. He had considerable luggage, and among other
things there was a heavy box that it took two men to handle. The man had them
put <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span> the box in his
cabin, although some other things he permitted to be placed in the hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had only been a day or two out, when Ramsay was killed by a
tackle block that fell from aloft while he was walking the deck. The mate,
Manuel, who Dick explained was the big Portuguese, took command and the captain
was buried at sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;The passenger seemed to grow nervous after the captain&#8217;s death,
and kept pretty closely to his room. But he couldn&#8217;t stay there always,
and one day when he entered it he found Manuel there trying to open the chest.
There was a fight right away, and in the struggle the man was badly hurt by a
blow from a hatchet that Manuel had in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole crew had been drawn to the spot by the struggle, and Dick
says they were all scared, even Manuel himself, at the outcome of the fight.
Manuel would have robbed, but neither he nor the others would have gone so far
as to murder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they had got into the scrape now, and felt that they might as well
be hung for sheep as for lambs. They had passed Bartanet Shoals a few hours
before the fight took place&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Mr. Montgomery kept harping on that, I
suppose,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;It was one of his last conscious
thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must have been it,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;They opened the
box and got the surprise of their lives. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_85'></a>85</span> Dick said that there was nothing but gold pieces, and
it shone so that it dazzled their eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say how much there was?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dick said he didn&#8217;t know, but it must have been a great many
thousands of dollars. Dick was an ignorant fellow and he said he didn&#8217;t
know that there was as much money as that in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, there was more money than any one of them could ever hope
to earn at the beggarly wages they were getting. They took an oath then and
there that they would divide the gold evenly among them, and all swore to take
the life of any one who betrayed the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t dare keep on their voyage to the port where they
were going. There would have been too much explaining to do. So they made for a
cove on the coast&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was it? What was its name? How far from here?&#8221; came in a
chorus from the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cove on the coast,&#8221; went on Mr. Lee, disregarding the
interruption, &#8220;where they could think things over and make their plans.
They anchored at a little distance out, and came into the cove in a small boat,
carrying the chest of gold and the unconscious passenger. They carried the gold
ashore and left the passenger in the boat. But in the excitement, they must have
failed to draw the boat far enough up on the sand. At all events, it got adrift
and floated out into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;When they
missed it, they were panic-stricken. They didn&#8217;t know what to do with the
gold. If it had been in small bills that couldn&#8217;t have been traced, the
matter would have been easy enough. But they feared that if Mr. Montgomery
escaped and recovered there would be a regular hue and cry, and a close watch
kept for any one who was spending gold pieces, which is rather an unusual thing
to do in these days of paper money. Of course, professional sharpers would have
found some way out, but these men were not that, and now that they had taken
part in a crime they were in deadly fear of detection.</p>

<p>&#8220;They concluded at last that the best thing they could do for the
present was to leave the gold in its chest carefully concealed in that lonely
place, sail their ship to some harbor where they could sell it for what it would
bring, and then ship together on a long voyage that would keep them out of the
country until the storm blew over. Thus each could watch the others and when
they got back they could get the chest and divide the gold among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom told me that when Dick got to this point, he couldn&#8217;t hold
in any longer but asked him point blank where it was that he had buried the
treasure chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We didn&#8217;t bury it,&#8217; Dick answered. &#8216;We hid it
in&#8211;&#8211;&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>&#8220;Just then
the skipper called Tom and he had to leave Dick, but promised to come back as
soon as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one duty after another kept him busy, and he wasn&#8217;t able to
go back to Dick for some time. Then he found that a great change had taken
place. Dick&#8217;s fever had gone down, he had a little appetite, and it was
clear that he was on the mend. Perhaps the relieving of his conscience by
telling of the crime had helped him get better.</p>

<p>&#8220;However that might have been, he was a very different Dick from the
night before. His mouth was shut as tight as an oyster, and Tom couldn&#8217;t
get another word out of him. When he reminded him that he hadn&#8217;t finished
his confession of the night before, Dick stared at him coldly and asked him what
confession he was talking about. Tom told him, and Dick said that was the first
he had heard of anything of the kind. Said he must have been out of his mind, if
he&#8217;d gotten off any nonsense like that. And he gave Tom a hint that it
wouldn&#8217;t be healthy for him, if he spread the report among the rest of the
crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t need to do that, for Tom had no idea of talking. He
knew that if he did, it would be a very easy thing for one of the half dozen
confederates to knock him senseless and heave him overboard some dark night. So
he kept a quiet tongue in his head, and neither he nor Dick ever <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span> referred to the matter
again as long as Tom was on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;As luck would have it, they soon after fell in with another ship of
the same line that was on its way back home. Some of her crew had been swept
overboard in a cyclone, and she was short-handed. Her skipper asked the captain
of Tom&#8217;s craft to let him have a couple of men and he consented. Tom and
one other sailor volunteered, and they were transferred to the other ship. It
was a lucky thing for Tom, because his old ship went down in a hurricane off
Cape Horn and every soul on board was lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that certain?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;As certain as those things can ever be,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;That was as much as eight years ago, and not a single man of her crew has
ever turned up anywhere. If any one of them had been picked up by another ship,
the matter would have been reported as soon as the ship reached port. Of course,
there&#8217;s a bare chance that some of them might have reached a desert island
and still be alive. But that&#8217;s so unlikely that it might as well be put
out of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of Tom Bixby?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shipped on a Canadian sealer soon after he was here, and I
haven&#8217;t seen or heard of him since.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>&#8220;Is there
any chance that he might have gone on a still hunt for the treasure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Tom,&#8221; laughed Mr. Lee. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t have enough to
go on. But he certainly was sore at the skipper for having called him away from
Dick just when he did. Another minute&#8211;yes, another ten seconds&#8211;and
Dick would have blurted out just where the treasure was hidden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been fearfully exasperating to come so near finding out
and yet just to miss it,&#8221; remarked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lucky thing for Ross that he didn&#8217;t find out,&#8221;
interjected Fred. &#8220;Tom didn&#8217;t know who the rightful owner was, and
if he&#8217;d found it he would have kept the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that he wouldn&#8217;t have tried to find out very
hard,&#8221; laughed their host. &#8220;Sailor men have peculiar ideas about
hidden treasure. The general rule they go by is that &#8216;findings is
keepings.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there are a good many besides sailors who would go by the same
rule,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Human nature is much the same, no matter what a man&#8217;s calling
is,&#8221; assented Mr. Lee. &#8220;But you lads have kept me talking a long
while, and I&#8217;ve got to look after my work. I&#8217;ve given you all I know
about the Montgomery case, and it&#8217;s up to you now to put your heads
together and make the most of it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>UNCLE AARON REJOICES</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fred, drawing a long breath and looking around at
his companions after Mr. Lee had left the room, &#8220;we&#8217;ve certainly got
more than we expected from this after-dinner talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we didn&#8217;t know at the start that we&#8217;d get a
thing,&#8221; exulted Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer that dad never mentioned the matter to me,&#8221;
mused Lester. &#8220;Still I was a little chap when it all happened, and the
whole thing has been almost forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the net result?&#8221; asked Bill. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t the least idea yet where the treasure really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Fred. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t. And yet we&#8217;ve
made a long step forward. In the first place, we know that Ross was absolutely
honest and truthful in all that he said. Then, too, we know from Tom&#8217;s
story that the treasure wasn&#8217;t taken away by the smugglers then, and
couldn&#8217;t have been afterwards, since they were all drowned. So we can be
sure that it&#8217;s still where they left it unless some one else has stumbled
on it, which isn&#8217;t at all likely. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> Further than that, we know where the man lives who
picked up Mr. Montgomery when he was adrift, and there&#8217;s no knowing what
we may be able to get out of him. It seems to me that we&#8217;re already far
ahead of where we were this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another point too, Fred,&#8221; broke in Teddy.
&#8220;Dick told Tom that the chest wasn&#8217;t buried, but was hidden
somewhere. That gives us a mighty good tip. If we didn&#8217;t know that, we
might waste our time and break our backs in digging, when it wouldn&#8217;t do
us a bit of good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny, too,&#8221; remarked Lester. &#8220;You&#8217;d
think that burying would have been the first thing they thought of. In all the
stories one reads of pirate hoards, the treasure is buried deep down in the
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the pirate usually shot the man who dug the hole and left his
skeleton to guard the treasure,&#8221; said Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Manuel might have done something of the kind, if there
hadn&#8217;t been so many in the crew,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He seems from
all accounts to have been more desperate and bloody-minded than the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t worry our brains as to why it wasn&#8217;t
done,&#8221; remarked Teddy. &#8220;The only thing that concerns us is that it
was hidden instead of buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hidden is a pretty big word,&#8221; put in skeptical Bill. &#8220;It
might be hidden on a mountain top or in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_92'></a>92</span> a thicket or in a hollow tree or under water or in a
cave or any other old place. Instead of making the problem easier, it seems to
me it makes it harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see Bill getting cross-eyed trying to keep one eye on the
mountains and the other on the sea,&#8221; jibed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s all right,&#8221; assented Fred. &#8220;He acts as a
brake to hold us in check and keep us from going ahead too fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we can cut out the mountain top idea,&#8221; put in Lester,
&#8220;as there aren&#8217;t any mountains of any size close to the
coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must remember, too,&#8221; chimed in Fred, &#8220;that they
were in a hurry to get away. Mr. Montgomery was adrift, and they didn&#8217;t
know at just what moment he might be picked up. Of course, he was unconscious,
but he might come to his senses at any time and tell his rescuers just what had
happened. In that case, the fat would be in the fire right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lester thoughtfully, &#8220;whatever was done had to
be done in a hurry. It&#8217;s a dead sure thing that they didn&#8217;t go far
in from the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the same reason, we can dismiss the hollow tree idea,&#8221; said
Teddy. &#8220;Those things can&#8217;t be found just when you want them, and
they didn&#8217;t have time to hunt around for one. Besides it would take a
mighty big hollow to hold a chest as big as that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll
consider the other possibilities later,&#8221; summed up Fred. &#8220;For the
present, the one thing on which I guess we&#8217;re all agreed is that the chest
was hidden somewhere close to the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing we fellows must do above everything
else,&#8221; recommended Lester, &#8220;and that is to keep the whole thing
absolutely secret. Even when we go to see Mark, we must put our questions in
such a way that he&#8217;ll not have the slightest suspicion of what we&#8217;re
really after. He might set his tongue wagging, and some reporter might get wind
of it and put it in a local paper. Then it would be copied in others, and the
first thing we knew it would be written up for the front page of the Sunday
edition of a city paper with all sorts of scareheads and pictures. That would
put the hoodoo on us for fair. We&#8217;d be followed and spied on, and the
first thing you know some other party would be finding the money and Ross
wouldn&#8217;t get a dollar of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Tom Bixby, if he&#8217;s still alive, knows something about
it, but that was so long ago that he probably only thinks of it once in a while,
and if he should speak of it to any of his mates it would be put down only as a
sailor&#8217;s yarn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred, you and Teddy will have to tell your folks, because it&#8217;s
only right that your Uncle Aaron, who is so heavy a creditor, should know about
it, and then, too, he may be able to give us some information <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> that will help. But you
can give the tip to the folks at home that it is to be kept strictly among
themselves. Dad, of course, won&#8217;t let on to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;that we ought to write to
Uncle Aaron right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you fellows do that then, while I&#8217;m over in
Bartanet,&#8221; suggested Lester. &#8220;I have to go over there this afternoon
to get supplies. Want to come along, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; answered Bill, rising and stretching himself.
&#8220;I need a little fresh air and exercise after the big dinner I&#8217;ve
just put away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rushton boys, left alone, got out pen and paper and prepared to send the
momentous news to their family at Oldtown.</p>

<p>Up to now, letters to their Uncle Aaron had been rather hard to write.
Sometimes they had been little notes of thanks for presents sent to them at
Christmas or on birthdays. Often&#8211;much too often&#8211;they had been
apologies that their parents had forced them to write for some piece of mischief
that had offended their uncle. He had usually been so crusty and had so
obviously resented the fact that they had ever been born to cause him trouble,
that they had usually approached the task of writing with the feeling of
martyrs.</p>

<p>This time it was different. Mr. Aaron Rushton, though by no means a miser,
was sufficiently fond <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_95'></a>95</span> of money, and took great care to get all that was
rightfully his. Therefore the boys knew that the letter, telling of the bare
possibility of getting back such a large sum, would be very welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see his face when he reads it,&#8221; chuckled
Teddy. &#8220;By the way, Fred, who shall write it, you or I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do it,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He&#8217;s always been sorer at
you than he has at me, and this will help square you with him. While
you&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;ll write a line to mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of me writing a letter to him that really pleases him!&#8221;
laughed Teddy. &#8220;It will be the first time in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We really have an awful lot to thank Uncle Aaron for, although he
didn&#8217;t think he was doing us a favor,&#8221; replied his brother.
&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for his insisting on it, we wouldn&#8217;t have
gone to Rally Hall, we wouldn&#8217;t have met Bill and Lester, and we
wouldn&#8217;t have had the glorious times we&#8217;ve had so far this
summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t have thrashed Andy Shanks,&#8221; grinned
Teddy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that when you&#8217;re counting up the
advantages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a satisfaction,&#8221; grinned Fred. &#8220;But go ahead now
with that letter, or we won&#8217;t get through by the time Bill and Lester come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Teddy set to work. He wrote at first of ordinary matters,
keeping the tidbit till the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_96'></a>96</span> last. When he came to that he wrote exultingly,
telling in glowing terms all they had found out and all that they hoped to find
in the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to tell him how Ross and his mother appreciate the
way he&#8217;s acted toward them,&#8221; suggested Fred, himself busy on the
letter to his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you reminded me of that,&#8221; said Teddy, making the
addition. &#8220;I was so wrapped up in the rest of it that I&#8217;d have
surely forgotten that.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last both letters were finished and stamped ready for mailing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; remarked Teddy, with a sigh of relief, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
wager there&#8217;ll be some little excitement at home when they read that
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only we can follow it up with another one later on, telling that we
have actually found the chest of gold!&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we do, you&#8217;ll have the pleasure of writing it,&#8221;
declared Teddy. &#8220;Turn about is fair play.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was late on the following day when the letters reached the Rushton home.
The head of the house had not yet returned from his office in the city, and the
only people in the house, besides Martha, the colored cook, were Mrs. Rushton
and Mr. Aaron Rushton.</p>

<p>The latter had been detained at home by an attack of neuralgia, and was in a
bad temper. At his best, he could never be called a congenial companion, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span> but when to his naturally
surly disposition neuralgia was added, he became simply intolerable. Mrs.
Rushton&#8217;s nerves had been worn to a frazzle by having him around, and it
was almost with a hysterical feeling of relief that she pounced upon the letters
that Martha brought in. There were several, but that from Fred was on top.</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter from Fred!&#8221; she exclaimed delightedly, as she
recognized the writing. &#8220;I wonder what the dear boys are doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doing everybody, probably,&#8221; said her brother-in-law gloomily.
&#8220;Especially that boy Teddy. He&#8217;s either in mischief or he&#8217;s
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Aaron, you oughtn&#8217;t to talk that way about Teddy,&#8221;
protested Mrs. Rushton, bridling in defence of her offspring. &#8220;There are
plenty of worse boys than Teddy in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, but I never met them,&#8221; retorted Aaron Rushton.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a great, big heart,&#8221; went on Teddy&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;His gall has impressed me more than any other bodily organ he
owns,&#8221; was the reply. Evidently Mr. Aaron Rushton&#8217;s temper had a
razor edge that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forgot how he got back your watch and papers,&#8221; Mrs. Rushton
indignantly reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t forget that if it hadn&#8217;t been for him I
wouldn&#8217;t have lost them,&#8221; snapped Aaron. &#8220;Who <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span> was it that hit the horse
with a ball and caused the runaway that might have cost me my life? Who was it
that painted Jed Muggs&#8217; team red, white and blue on the Fourth of July?
Who was it that nearly caused a panic on the common, when he set those mice
loose among the women?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rushton knew only too well who it was, and she took refuge in
generalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just the dearest boy, anyway,&#8221; she declared
defiantly. &#8220;He&#8217;s fond of mischief like all boys of his age, but he
never did a mean or dishonorable thing in his life. And didn&#8217;t I hear you
tell Mr. Barrett once, just after you got your papers back, that your nephews
were the finest boys in Oldtown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did, I must have been out of my mind,&#8221; growled Aaron, as a
twinge of neuralgia made him wince. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll admit that the boys
are angels. Heaven forgive me for lying. Go ahead and read your
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rushton had already torn the envelope open and was deep in the
reading of its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she remarked, after a paragraph or two, &#8220;Fred says
here that Teddy was writing a letter to you at the same time. I wonder if
it&#8217;s among these,&#8221; and she turned over the other letters in her lap.
&#8220;Oh, here it is, sure enough,&#8221; she added as she saw Teddy&#8217;s
scrawling writing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Aaron Rushton
himself was somewhat startled at the unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; he growled, reaching for it. &#8220;What has he been
doing to me now that he has to apologize for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a nice thing to say,&#8221; protested Mrs. Rushton.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t a boy write to his own uncle without having an apology to
make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Teddy,&#8221; said Aaron with conviction.</p>

<p>He took the letter and tore the envelope with studied indifference, to
conceal his real curiosity.</p>

<p>The first few paragraphs dealt with ordinary topics, and he passed them over
quickly. Then the letter seemed to grip him. He read with ever increasing
excitement, while Mrs. Rushton watched him wonderingly. He finished it at last
and leaped to his feet with an exulting exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eureka!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Those boys are wonders!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN EXCITING CONFERENCE</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Rushton gasped with astonishment. It was an unusual thing for Aaron
Rushton to let himself go in this manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what on earth is the matter?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter enough!&#8221; replied Aaron, beginning to pace the floor.
&#8220;The best news I&#8217;ve heard for years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has any one left you a legacy?&#8221; she queried, not knowing of
anything else that could cause him such joyous emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No such luck as that,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but it may amount to
the same thing in the long run.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down again, fixed his glasses on the bridge of his nose and again ran
over the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, Aaron, don&#8217;t keep me on
tenter-hooks!&#8221; cried Mrs. Rushton, no longer able to restrain her
curiosity. &#8220;What can Teddy have to say that makes you feel so
good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he replied, thrusting the letter into her hand,
&#8220;read it for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took it, while he resumed his pacing, and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span> for the first time in years he actually
hummed a tune.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chest of gold!&#8221; he muttered to himself. &#8220;Twelve thousand
dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rushton hurriedly ran over the first few lines of the letter. Then she
uttered a frightened exclamation and her cheeks grew pale. She had reached the
part where Teddy told of Fred&#8217;s daring exploit in diving overboard to
rescue Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shark!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;And my Fred in the
water!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother the shark,&#8221; cried Aaron impatiently. &#8220;It
didn&#8217;t bite him, did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it might have,&#8221; returned Fred&#8217;s mother, in tones
that were a blending of pride and terror. &#8220;My brave, rash boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8216;brave, rash boy&#8217; is all right,&#8221; retorted Aaron.
&#8220;Get on to the really important part of the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rushton darted an indignant glance at her brother-in-law, but went on,
her eyes shining and her breath coming fast. When she had finished she was
almost as excited as Aaron Rushton himself.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in mutual congratulation, he rejoicing in the
unexpected windfall, she exulting in the part her boys had played in the
affair.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Mansfield Rushton, returning <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> from business, strode into the room. He
tossed his hat on a chair and greeted his wife affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be conducting a correspondence school, judging from the
letters on hand,&#8221; he said gaily.</p>

<p>He seemed to bring a flood of sunshine with him, and it was easy to see where
Fred and Teddy got their high spirits and joyous outlook on life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d never guess what&#8217;s happened, Mansfield!&#8221; cried
his wife. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just got letters from the boys and there&#8217;s
the greatest news,&#8221; she added proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see them,&#8221; he said with quick interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read this one first,&#8221; she said, thrusting Teddy&#8217;s letter
into his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; he said in surprise, as he glanced at the address,
&#8220;this is directed to Aaron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Rushton replied. She could not forbear the thrust and
added: &#8220;Aaron thought it was an apology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron Rushton squirmed in his chair a little uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what I thought,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;Go ahead,
Mansfield, and then we&#8217;ll talk the matter over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mansfield Rushton&#8217;s quick eye ran rapidly over the lines while the
others watched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Fred and Teddy!&#8221; he cried at the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span> end. &#8220;They&#8217;re boys worth
having, eh, Agnes? What&#8217;s your opinion, Aaron?&#8221; he added slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done very well in this case,&#8221; his brother was
forced to admit, though it cost him a pang. &#8220;If this thing really pans out
as I hope it will, I&#8217;ll see that they get a liberal share of what they
turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll get all the pay they want in the fun of hunting for
it,&#8221; laughed their father. &#8220;I know if I were their age,
there&#8217;d be nothing that would suit me better than searching for hidden
gold. I&#8217;m so much of a boy even now, that if I were down there I&#8217;d
go into the thing with the same zest as the boys themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to write to them this very night,&#8221; said Aaron,
&#8220;and send them a little money for current expenses. They may run across
somebody who can give them some information, and there&#8217;s nothing like a
little money to make people talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I certainly hope you get this, Aaron,&#8221; said his brother
heartily. &#8220;Twelve thousand dollars is a whole lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is in these hard times,&#8221; answered Aaron.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hit rather hard in some of my investments lately, and
this would do a good deal toward helping me out of the hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it that you never happened to mention this matter to me?&#8221;
asked Mansfield. &#8220;I never <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_104'></a>104</span> heard you speak of Montgomery or of any money that
he owed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a long time ago, when I lent it to him,&#8221; returned Aaron.
&#8220;All of fifteen years, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that it was a good deal to put into one loan,&#8221;
remarked Mansfield. &#8220;What security did he offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a matter of security, so much as it was of friendship
and gratitude,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;James Montgomery was one of the
most upright men I ever met. His word was his bond, and when he borrowed money
it was his character that was the best collateral.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had lent me money when I was struggling to get ahead in the world.
I had expanded too rapidly in my desire to get ahead, and I was so tied up and
so in need of ready cash that I was right on the brink of failure. I
couldn&#8217;t get a loan from the banks, and I was almost in despair when I
applied to James Montgomery. He went over my affairs with me, saw that I was
really solvent, and that the trouble was only that immediate cash was needed to
pull me through.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was doing well in business then, and he lent me the money and gave
me all the time I needed to pay it back. It wasn&#8217;t long before I was on my
feet again, and the first thing I did was to pay him back the full amount with
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I vowed to myself then, that if the chance ever <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span> offered, I&#8217;d do the same by him
as he had done by me. And it wasn&#8217;t a meaningless vow, for I&#8217;ve
never felt more warmly toward any one outside my own people before or since.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was some years, though, before I got my chance. Then I learned that
he was in straits. He had built up a big business, but hard times came and
squeezed him, and a big bank failure put the finishing touch to his ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know of his predicament until it was too late to save
him. But after he had recovered from the illness that followed his failure, I
went to him and offered him as much money as he needed to start over again. His
wife had a little property on the coast of Canada and with enough money to
develop it, it promised to yield big returns. All told, I lent him about twelve
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;He paid the interest promptly every six months, and I never worried
about the principal. I was sure if he lived that I&#8217;d get it back, and if
he died, I&#8217;d charge it up to profit and loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice that Teddy says in his letter you refused to take the
property he left as payment for your debt,&#8221; said Mrs. Rushton. &#8220;I
think that was fine of you, Aaron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t prey on widows and orphans,&#8221; replied Aaron,
dismissing the matter with a curt wave of the hand. &#8220;Least of all, on the
widow and orphan of James Montgomery.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;But
didn&#8217;t you hear of this chest of gold at the time Mrs. Montgomery wrote to
you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Rushton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in a vague and jumbled way,&#8221; answered Aaron. &#8220;She was
so much upset and distressed that I couldn&#8217;t make much of her letter. I
gathered that he had taken a box containing a large amount of money aboard a
coastwise craft, and that he had been found later drifting in an open boat. He
had been wounded, and the presumption was, of course, that he had been assaulted
and robbed of the money. But, of course, I concluded, as I suppose every one
else did, that the money had been divided and spent. At any rate, I gave it up
for gone from that moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you follow the matter up in any way?&#8221; asked his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to any great extent,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I sent a
specialist up to Canada to see if he could do anything toward getting back poor
Montgomery&#8217;s reason, and I offered a reward for the discovery and arrest
of the thieves. But nothing came of it, and after Montgomery died a year or so
later, I gave the matter up. I haven&#8217;t thought of it for a long time,
until this letter came to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it looks as though there is a chance at least of getting the
gold,&#8221; commented Mansfield Rushton.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all these years!&#8221; added Mrs. Rushton, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span> whose imagination had been captured by
the romance and tragedy of the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s only a chance,&#8221; said Aaron, on whom doubts
began to crowd after the first exhilaration. &#8220;They&#8217;re a long way off
from finding it yet. They have only the most slender kind of clues.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe they&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said Mansfield, buoyantly.
&#8220;Those boys seem to have a knack of getting what they go after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; chimed in his wife, her face lighting up, &#8220;look at
the way they exposed that masquerade of the ghost out on the Garwood ranch this
summer. And think how cleverly they got on the trail of the tramps who stole
your watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; assented Aaron slowly, as though the concession was
wrenched from him. &#8220;They do seem to get there one way or the other. I
don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re smart or
lucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re both,&#8221; said Mrs. Rushton proudly.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A FEROCIOUS ENEMY</span></h2>

<p>When the boys woke the morning after their adventure, their first thought was
of the weather. They had set their hearts on taking the trip over to Milton to
call on Mark Taylor and they would have been sorely disappointed at any
indication of a storm.</p>

<p>But they could have spared their worry. There was not a cloud in the sky, the
sun was rising brilliantly in the east, and the waves fell in a soft monotonous
murmur at the foot of the lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a dandy day,&#8221; reported Teddy gleefully,
as he came back from the window. &#8220;Get up there, you sleepy heads,&#8221;
he commanded, with the conscious virtue of the one who rises first.</p>

<p>Three rumpled heads turned on the pillows of the various cots in the big room
where the boys slept. A well-aimed pillow caught one of them plump and full, and
caused a hasty withdrawal beneath the sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut out the rough house, or I&#8217;ll get up there and fan
you,&#8221; came the drowsy voice of Bill, who happened to be the victim.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8220;No
danger,&#8221; jeered Teddy. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t ambition enough to make a
move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had half sleep enough,&#8221; yawned Fred. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you get up in the middle of the night and be done with
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Tis the voice of the sluggard, I hear him
complain,&#8217;&#8221; quoted his brother. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be as lazy
as this bunch of hoboes. If you don&#8217;t hurry, I&#8217;ll go out and find
that chest of gold all by my lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mention of the gold had a magical effect. It acted like a dousing of cold
water. In a moment the boys were on their feet and hurrying into their
clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;By ginger! I hadn&#8217;t had time to think of that,&#8221; remarked
Bill, as he poured the water in his basin, &#8220;or you wouldn&#8217;t have
needed a pillow to rout us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad has the coffee pot on already,&#8221; said Lester as a savory
aroma came up the stairs. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a wiggle on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys trooped down the stairs to find breakfast ready for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to eat a plenty, fellows,&#8221; observed Lester, setting them
the example. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a long sail before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads needed no urging and the way the food disappeared was almost
miraculous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Lester when the breakfast had been <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> finished, &#8220;you
fellows go out and get the boat ready to start, while I get enough grub together
to last a couple of days. We may not always have clams and bluefish just when we
want them, and I&#8217;m not going to take any risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll be away over night?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;Maybe
we&#8217;ll be gone for more than one. It&#8217;s a pretty stiff sail up there,
and we may have to do a good deal of tacking on the way back. Then, too, Mark
may not be in when we get there, and we may have to wait till he gets
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a fellow is this Taylor, anyhow?&#8221; asked Fred.
&#8220;Has he any family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he lives all alone in a little cabin down near the beach. Spends
his time fishing and doing odd jobs. He&#8217;s a little wizened-up fellow.
He&#8217;s fond of talking, and all we&#8217;ll have to do is to get him started
and he&#8217;ll do the rest. I only hope we&#8217;ll find him in condition to
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark is a little too fond of a black bottle that he keeps in his
cabin,&#8221; explained Lester. &#8220;But he&#8217;s usually sober in the
daytime, and if we get to him before night, he&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went down to the little dock where the <i>Ariel</i> was riding. They
had all grown more or less expert in handling her since their arrival at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span> Shoals, and in a
very short time they had her ready for the trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Uncle Aaron has got my letter yet,&#8221; remarked Teddy,
as he helped Bill pull up the anchor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied his brother, &#8220;but he&#8217;s sure to get
it before the day is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see his face when he reads it,&#8221; chuckled
Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t usually so anxious to see his face,&#8221; laughed
Fred. &#8220;That time, for instance, when he came up on the bank after his
ducking in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Teddy. &#8220;But this time things are
different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lester had made several trips to the boat, each time loaded with provisions,
and by the time everything else was ready the little larder was well
stocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger of starving on this trip,&#8221; smiled Mr. Lee, who had
come down to see them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; laughed Lester. &#8220;Now, Dad, don&#8217;t worry if
we&#8217;re gone longer than we expect to be. We&#8217;ll be back when we get
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not worry,&#8221; promised his father. &#8220;Any one who
can take a boat through Sentinel Rocks in such a blow as we had the other day,
can get out of any kind of scrape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand genially in farewell as the <i>Ariel</i> fell away and set
her course for Milton.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve a following wind,&#8221; remarked
Lester, as he settled himself at the tiller, &#8220;and if it holds out, we
ought to make Milton in three hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to keep a sharp lookout for Mark on the way,&#8221; suggested
Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Lester. &#8220;He&#8217;s more than
likely to be out fishing somewhere in our course. And this time we won&#8217;t
have to rely on Bill&#8217;s eyes alone, for I&#8217;ve brought a pair of
dad&#8217;s binoculars along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve brought something else along,&#8221; said Teddy, as his
eyes fell on a big hook at the end of an iron chain. &#8220;I never saw this
thing before. What are you going to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hook a shark if I can,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; came in an excited exclamation from the other three.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said,&#8221; repeated Lester, enjoying the
sensation that his words had caused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever caught any before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll catch sight of one?&#8221;</p>

<p>The questions poured in upon him and Lester laughed, as he raised his hand in
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing at a time,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Anybody&#8217;d think
this was a political meeting where every one&#8217;s trying to heckle the
speaker at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught them before,&#8221; he went on, replying to the
first question that had been hurled at him. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_113'></a>113</span> &#8220;Not often, of course, because they&#8217;re
not as common as other fish. But there are altogether too many on this part of
the coast. They scare off the fish and break the nets of the fishermen. Then,
too, they&#8217;re dangerous if any one falls overboard, and no one can be
comfortable when he knows those pirates are cruising around, ready to gobble him
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly a pleasant sensation,&#8221; agreed Fred, with
a little shiver as he thought of the time he had gone over the side for
Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the people along the coast hate them like poison,&#8221; continued
Lester, &#8220;and it is looked on as a public duty to put them out of business
whenever they are come across.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the way we feel out West about rattlesnakes,&#8221; put in
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; agreed Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll run across the very fellow we saw in the
storm,&#8221; suggested Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; assented Bill, &#8220;although there won&#8217;t be
any strawberry mark by which we can identify him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t turn up, his brother or his cousin will do just as
well,&#8221; laughed Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of bait do you use?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a few chunks of pork stored away in the locker,&#8221;
returned Lester. &#8220;If we catch sight of one swimming around, we&#8217;ll
throw over some small <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_114'></a>114</span> pieces. Their sense of smell is wonderful, and
they&#8217;ll get on the job right away. The shark will follow us for more, and
just when he thinks he&#8217;s found a regular meal, we&#8217;ll heave over the
big piece attached to the hook. He&#8217;ll nab it in a hurry, and then his
guileless and unsuspicious nature will receive a sudden shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you get him on board?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s a big fellow, we&#8217;ll not,&#8221; was the answer,
&#8220;unless we can get him near enough to stun him with a hatchet. Even on
board a big ship the men often have to attach the rope to a windlass to draw the
big fellows in while they&#8217;re still full of fight. Even if he were stunned,
I don&#8217;t think that all of us pulling together could lift his dead weight
on board the <i>Ariel</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what would we do with him?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have to tow him astern until we could run in somewhere and
pull him ashore,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the fishermen
round here usually do when they hook one. Once get him on the beach, and the
rest is easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll have a shark steak for supper,&#8221; said
Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it,&#8221; said Lester, with a
grimace. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tasted it and I must admit that it&#8217;s pretty
rank. I wouldn&#8217;t care to have it as a steady diet, unless I were starving
and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span> couldn&#8217;t
get anything else. The Chinese make soup of its fins though, and they say that
it&#8217;s dandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you&#8217;d try to stun him with a hatchet,&#8221; said Bill,
the skeptic. &#8220;But suppose you couldn&#8217;t get him near enough for
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d try something else,&#8221; replied Lester.
&#8220;Here, Teddy, take the tiller for a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy did as requested, and Lester, reaching down into the cabin, drew out
and displayed to the astonished eyes of the boys a long harpoon.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAPTURING THE SHARK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Where on earth did you get that harpoon?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to father,&#8221; was Lester&#8217;s answer. &#8220;He
shipped on board a whaler once and made a three-year cruise. He was the head
harpooner of the first mate&#8217;s boat and many&#8217;s the time this old
harpoon has struck a ninety barrel whale. Dad has any number of yarns to spin
about it, and some day I&#8217;ll set him going and you&#8217;ll hear them
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be dandy!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing stirs me up so much as a whaling story. I&#8217;ve often thought
I&#8217;d like to make a voyage on a whaler when I am old enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal of romance and excitement about it,&#8221;
admitted Lester, &#8220;but it&#8217;s very hard and dangerous work. A man takes
his life in his hands when he ships for such a cruise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This certainly looks as though it meant business,&#8221; commented
Bill, as he examined curiously the broad, flat, triangular head. &#8220;The edge
is like a razor, and nothing could pull this barb loose after it once
entered.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>The shank was
about two feet long and served as a socket to the shaft which gave a total
length to the harpoon of more than six feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but it&#8217;s heavy,&#8221; said Fred, as he lifted it. &#8220;It
must take some muscle to handle a thing like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes a good deal of experience to master it,&#8221; said
Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how to throw it?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father has shown me how, and I&#8217;ve practised a good deal on and
off just for fun,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I might be able to hit a shark
with it, if he wasn&#8217;t very far off, and I might not. I&#8217;d have a
chance though, and if I missed I could try again. This rope attached to it
prevents its being lost, and I could draw it in again and make another attempt
at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course this is rather old fashioned these days,&#8221; Lester went
on. &#8220;Now, in most of the whaling boats, they put the harpoon in a gun,
just as you might thrust a ramrod down the muzzle of a rifle. The harpoon has an
explosive shell attached to its head like the torpedo of a submarine. The
harpoon is shot from the gun, and after it leaves the muzzle, a rocket charge
attached to it carries it still further. When it hits the whale, the bomb
explodes and it&#8217;s all over. Of course, it&#8217;s safer and surer than the
old way, but it&#8217;s too much like <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_118'></a>118</span> business. It does away with the exciting, desperate
struggle between man and whale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What stories this old weapon could tell, if it could only talk,&#8221;
mused Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and they&#8217;d be more exciting than anything you read in
fiction,&#8221; added Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may have a chance to use it before the day is over,&#8221; said
Teddy hopefully, as he looked over the waves on every side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bare possibility,&#8221; assented Lester. &#8220;I
thought it wouldn&#8217;t do any harm to bring it along anyhow just on the
chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows want to keep a keen lookout for anything that looks like a
fin,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It would be too bad to let any guilty shark
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Lester had charge of the tiller and Fred was looking after the sail, the
work of watching devolved on Teddy and Bill. They took opposite sides of the
craft, Teddy handling Mr. Lee&#8217;s binoculars while Bill depended upon the
remarkably keen eyes with which nature had gifted him.</p>

<p>An hour went by, during which the little boat made rapid progress. But
nothing rewarded the vigil of the two, and Teddy began to grow disgusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing to-day, I guess,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s sent a wireless to the sharks telling them to keep out
of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after Lester has taken all that trouble in <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span> getting a warm welcome ready for
them,&#8221; mourned Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly very ungrateful on their part,&#8221; grinned
Bill.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;The shark who hides and runs away<br /> May live to bite another
day.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Teddy was the perpetrator of the lines.</p>

<p>Fred groaned and, as he made a pass at his brother with his unoccupied hand,
asked: &#8220;What have we done that such awful stuff should be pulled off on
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there!&#8221; shouted Bill suddenly. &#8220;I saw something just
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang out the flags,&#8221; drawled Fred unbelievingly. &#8220;Bill saw
something.&#8221;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;He saw the sea, he saw the sky,<br /> He saw the drifting clouds go
by,&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>chanted Teddy, the irrepressible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d see a couple of boobs, if I looked over your way,&#8221;
retorted Bill. &#8220;Cut out the chatter and hand me those glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The binoculars were passed over to him, and he turned them on an object far
out to starboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; he said exultingly a moment <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span> later. &#8220;I can see the dorsal fin
of a shark out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disbelief vanished before his confident tone, and all looked eagerly in the
direction he indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s only a floating bit of wood,&#8221; said Teddy
doubtfully, after a long gaze through the glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Lester look,&#8221; suggested Bill. &#8220;He knows a shark when
he sees one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lester relinquished the tiller to Bill and took a long, steady look through
the binoculars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill is right,&#8221; he announced at last. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shark
and a big one too. I guess we&#8217;re going to have some sport, after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how are we going to get a trial at him?&#8221; cried Teddy.
&#8220;He seems to be going in the opposite direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he won&#8217;t go far,&#8221; replied Lester with easy
confidence. &#8220;This is probably his feeding ground, and he&#8217;ll keep
going round and round in lazy circles. We&#8217;ll get a little nearer to him
before we do anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>He retook the tiller and changed the <i>Ariel&#8217;s</i> course toward the
spot where they had seen the shark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower the sail, now,&#8221; he commanded, when they had gone half a
mile. &#8220;Just keep up enough to give us steerage way. A shark thinks a
boat&#8217;s disabled when it isn&#8217;t moving much, and his instinct <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span> teaches him that the
occupants are probably in trouble and his chance of finally getting them will be
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that will bring him around?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll help, anyway,&#8221; replied Lester. &#8220;But to make it
surer, we&#8217;ll cut up the pork into small pieces and scatter it on the
water. He&#8217;ll smell it as sure as guns, and I&#8217;ll wager you that
before ten minutes are over you&#8217;ll see the old rascal swimming toward
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys got their clasp knives out at once and slashed the pork into bits,
taking care however not to touch the big piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming,&#8221; cried Teddy, after perhaps five minutes had
passed. &#8220;I saw his fin just then, not fifty feet away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pieces of pork were now bobbing up and down on the water at the stern of
the <i>Ariel</i>, which had almost stopped moving.</p>

<p>There was a twitch and one of the pieces disappeared. For an instant the boys
saw a long black body, the wet skin glistening in the rays of the sun like so
much velvet.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jinks!&#8221; whispered Bill in awe. &#8220;What an old
sockdolager!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the biggest I&#8217;ve ever seen,&#8221; returned
Lester. &#8220;Fellows of his size don&#8217;t get up this way very
often.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d
hate to fall overboard just now,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d make just about one mouthful for him,&#8221; was
Fred&#8217;s comforting rejoinder.</p>

<p>Lester was making feverish haste in the task of preparing the hook. He sank
it deep into the yielding pork, so that the point was at least six inches from
any surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he nibbles it off,&#8221; suggested Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharks don&#8217;t eat that way,&#8221; grinned Lester.
&#8220;They&#8217;re gluttons, and if they bite at all they take everything
down&#8211;hook, line and sinker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we couldn&#8217;t hold him if we did hook him,&#8221;
said Teddy. &#8220;He&#8217;d yank us overboard in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; replied Lester, at the same time
taking several turns around the mast with the slack of the rope.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to pull the mast out of the <i>Ariel</i> to get
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time all the floating bits of pork had been snapped up by this
cormorant of the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to like our lunch counter,&#8221; laughed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made him a steady customer, I guess,&#8221; returned
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he likes the samples, we&#8217;ll show him some of the real
goods,&#8221; chimed in Lester, as he prepared to throw the baited hook
overboard.</p>

<p>Just then the shark appeared, swimming lazily under the counter of the boat.
He was just under <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
the surface, and his glassy, wicked eyes looked full in the faces of the boys as
they crowded to the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, he&#8217;s a terror!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy, as the pirate of the
seas slowly moved past. &#8220;Is he going away do you think?&#8221; he asked in
alarm, as their intended prey vanished in the direction of the bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear,&#8221; responded Lester cheerily. &#8220;The pickings round
here are too good for him to think of going away just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wait till he comes around again and then make a
throw at him with the harpoon?&#8221; asked Bill. &#8220;I should think you
might hit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have a chance on earth,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;He&#8217;d dodge it like a flash of lightning. Then he&#8217;d take alarm
and make a quick sneak away from here. After we get him hooked, we can hold him
steady and I&#8217;ll have a chance to take aim.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a mighty heave, Lester threw the hook as far as he could over the stern.
The iron chain attached to it hung several inches under the water, but its
buoyancy kept the huge chunk of pork floating on the surface.</p>

<p>For several minutes the boys waited, their hearts beating so hard that it
almost seemed that they could be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s really cleared out and left us?&#8221; asked
Teddy, with disappointment in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; was Lester&#8217;s encouraging reply. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span> &#8220;He thinks he has
too soft a snap here to dream of giving it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Teddy&#8217;s question was answered by the shark himself. There was
a swish in the water on the other side of the boat, and the boys saw that
ominous fin sweep past.</p>

<p>The shark made straight for the hook with its tempting bait. But he sniffed
at it a moment and then commenced to swim slowly around it in wide circles.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a little bit suspicious,&#8221; whispered Lester.
&#8220;This is so much bigger than the others that it seems too good to be
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>For several minutes the great fish kept up his circular movement, but the
onlookers noticed that the circles were steadily growing smaller.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t resist it!&#8221; exulted Fred. &#8220;His judgment
tells him he&#8217;d better not, but his appetite urges him on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what I know of sharks, I&#8217;ll wager that his appetite will
win,&#8221; chuckled Lester.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shark seemed to reach a decision. Like a flash he darted toward
the bait and it disappeared in his rapacious maw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; yelled Teddy in uncontrollable excitement.
&#8220;He&#8217;s hooked at last!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A DESPERATE STRUGGLE</span></h2>

<p>For a second after swallowing the bait the shark remained perfectly still.
Then he darted away, only to be brought up with a round turn as he reached the
end of the rope.</p>

<p>It half stunned him and wholly bewildered him. He did not know what had
happened. He tried again, but with the same result.</p>

<p>Then, as he realized that he was hooked, the fury of the shark became
frightful. He sprang out of the water, lashing the waves into foam. The mast
creaked and strained, and the counter of the <i>Ariel</i> was pulled down until
the water rushed over the side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up the sail,&#8221; shouted Lester, rushing to the tiller.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll capsize us if we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy and Bill sprang to help Fred, and the sail was quickly hoisted. The
wind caught it at once, and as the breeze was a stiff one, it swelled out the
sail to the fullest extent, and with this added resistance against the struggles
of the shark, the <i>Ariel</i> was soon on an even keel.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Lester, with a sigh of relief, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> &#8220;now we can hold
our own. I thought for a minute that we were going over. And just now I
wouldn&#8217;t want to get too close to that pirate. Something seems to have
ruffled his temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rage of the shark was beyond belief. At first he tried to disgorge the
hook. But it had a secure grip and his efforts only served to exhaust him. Then
he snapped furiously at the chain with his mighty jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he can break it?&#8221; asked Bill anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life,&#8221; answered Lester serenely. &#8220;If it were
rope, he&#8217;d snap it as though it were thread. But even the jaws of a shark
can&#8217;t bite through a three-inch iron chain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shark darted here and there, trying by sudden jerks to break the chain.
But it held fast despite his tremendous efforts. Then he changed his tactics and
hurled himself against the <i>Ariel</i> with a force that made the timbers
shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he can start a leak?&#8221; asked Fred, as the deck shook
under him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; answered Lester, &#8220;but he might. The
<i>Ariel</i> is a mighty stout boat, but she wasn&#8217;t built to stand the
rushes of a crazy shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about giving him a clip with the hatchet the next time he comes
close enough?&#8221; suggested Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you try it,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Get a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span> tight grip on the rail
and bend away over. Then the next time he hits the boat, hit him on the nose. If
you catch him right it will stun him, and then I can finish him with the
harpoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred grasped the hatchet and disposed himself to take advantage of the next
rush. He gripped the rail with his left hand, while Bill and Teddy held his legs
tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go over, we go over with you,&#8221; Teddy assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shark would have a square meal then for fair,&#8221; laughed
Fred.</p>

<p>But the shark seemed to understand the trap laid for him and refused to fall
in with their plans. He resorted again to fierce lunging and diving, but did not
again approach the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s laughing at you,&#8221; jibed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he feels like laughing at anything just
now,&#8221; replied Fred, as he rose to his feet. &#8220;But he&#8217;s
evidently given up the idea of dashing his brains out against the
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be tired out before long,&#8221; judged Lester, &#8220;and
then I&#8217;ll give you a chance to see what an expert I am at throwing a
harpoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was clear that the sea pirate was exhausting his strength in his futile
struggles. His long career of cruelty and rapine was rapidly coming to an
end.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have a chance now,&#8221; said Lester, after <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> a few minutes more had
passed. &#8220;You take the tiller, Teddy, while Bill and Fred haul him
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this was not an easy task. Fred and Bill strained until they felt as
though their arms were being pulled out of their sockets. But the shark still
had enough strength left to make them pay dearly for every inch they gained.</p>

<p>But they were gaining, nevertheless. They wound the slack around a cleat as
they pulled it in, so as not to lose what they had once won. Lester joined them
after he had got the harpoon ready to throw, and with this reinforcement they
soon had the shark within three feet of the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s near enough,&#8221; said Lester, rising to his feet and
grasping the harpoon. &#8220;Now hold fast while I throw.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took careful aim, poised himself so as to get his full force into the cast
and let his weapon go. It hissed through the air straight at its quarry. But the
shark lunged aside, and the harpoon clove the water three inches to the
right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good shot, old scout!&#8221; cried Fred, as Lester, a little chagrined
at the miss, drew the dripping harpoon in over the side. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
your fault that you didn&#8217;t get him. It was going at him straight as an
arrow when he dodged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him yet,&#8221; muttered Lester to himself, as he
straightened up for another effort.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>He took his time
in aiming and summoned up all his strength. Then he threw.</p>

<p>The sharp point caught the shark a little behind the head and went clear
through his body. It must have struck a vital point for the monster gave one
convulsive leap and fell back in its death flurry, lashing the water into yeast.
Then it turned part way over and remained motionless, the leverage of the shaft
preventing it from turning wholly on its back.</p>

<p>A yell of triumph went up from the delighted boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory, hallelujah!&#8221; shouted Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a dandy throw, old scout!&#8221; cried Bill, clapping Lester
on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our lucky day,&#8221; yelled Fred in great exultation.</p>

<p>Lester flushed with pleasure. He had vindicated his throwing ability, and had
proved himself a worthy son of his sea-going forebears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father will be tickled to death when he hears of it,&#8221; he
remarked, trying to speak coolly, as though harpooning a shark was a daily
occurrence with him. &#8220;He hates the brutes with all his soul. He was nearly
nipped by one while in the water off the Bahamas, and his mates just hauled him
on board in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that we&#8217;ve got him, what are we going to do with
him?&#8221; asked practical Bill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;Could we
pull him on board, do you think?&#8221; inquired Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a hundred years,&#8221; replied Lester. &#8220;If we had a
pulley big enough and rope strong enough, we might hoist him up, but in no other
way. I guess the best way to do is to crowd on sail and tow him in to
Milton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much further do we have to go?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a matter of ten or twelve miles yet,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;If we were free, we could make it in a little over an hour the
way this wind is holding up. But the shark will be a big drag against us, and it
will take us at least twice as long. The harpoon sticking out at that angle
helps to keep us back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do we care how long it takes us to get there!&#8221; gloated
Teddy. &#8220;We have all the time there is and I don&#8217;t care whether it
takes us two hours or ten. We&#8217;ll have something to show the natives when
we do get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve seen plenty of sharks,&#8221; said Lester.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve often clapped eyes on one as big as
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After we reach Milton, how are we going to get the shark
ashore?&#8221; persisted Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be no trick at all,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;The
beach shelves out gradually there and I can take the <i>Ariel</i> pretty close
in. Then you fellows <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_131'></a>131</span> can tumble overboard and wade in, dragging the
shark with you. We couldn&#8217;t lift him, but it will be easy enough to drag
him up on the sand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m anxious to get close to him so that I can study him,&#8221;
said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have been nearer to one than you liked the day you went over
after Ross,&#8221; laughed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Fred, &#8220;he&#8217;d have had the laugh on me
then. But they laugh best who laugh last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;re laughing last, all right,&#8221; declared Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to your good arm and the old harpoon,&#8221; added Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have with us to-day, gentlemen,&#8221; said Teddy, assuming the air
and tone of a professional introducer, &#8220;two renowned throwers. Indeed, I
may say three.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman at the tiller, Mr. Lester Lee, throws the harpoon. This
other at the sheet, Mr. Frederic Rushton, throws the baseball. This idler at my
right, Mr. William Garwood, throws the lasso. I admit, gentlemen, with deep
regret, that of all this illustrious company I am the only one who doesn&#8217;t
throw something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes you do,&#8221; put in Bill quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You throw the bull,&#8221; said Bill.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PLEASANT SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>The other boys roared, and for a moment Teddy was disconcerted. But he
quickly recovered his balance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he retorted, frowning severely at the culprit,
&#8220;that this low-brow means to intimate that I am a Spanish athlete. I
should be deeply pained to know that any one who has been under the refining
influence of Rally Hall should indulge in the practice of slang. What would our
dear Doctor Rally say if he heard one of his pupils&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the question remained forever unanswered, for just then a piece of pork
that Bill had picked up from the deck whizzed past the orator&#8217;s face, and,
in the quick and undignified duck he made, Teddy lost the thread of his
discourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you two cut out the fooling and get down to business,&#8221;
grinned Lester. &#8220;Fred and I are the only ones doing anything, and
it&#8217;s time you loafers got busy. Bring out the grub and let&#8217;s have
something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s always in order, like a motion to adjourn,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> acquiesced Teddy.
&#8220;Come along, Bill, and we&#8217;ll show these fellows how to
cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>Teddy and Bill went down into the little cuddy, got out the tiny oil stove,
and the odors of sizzling bacon and steaming coffee soon made Lester and Fred
sniff the air hungrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how hungry I was till just now,&#8221; said the
latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t either,&#8221; returned Lester. &#8220;I was so worked
up over that tussle with the shark that I didn&#8217;t have time to think of
anything else. But now I&#8217;m hungry enough to eat nails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the way you refer to the meal we&#8217;re getting up,
you can&#8217;t have any,&#8221; threatened Teddy. &#8220;We may not be hotel
chefs, but we&#8217;ll not stand for having our eats compared to nails, will we,
Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a jugful!&#8221; answered Bill, as he scrambled some eggs in
the bacon grease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it all back,&#8221; laughed Lester.</p>

<p>Teddy cut some slices of bread and Bill opened a jar of marmalade, which they
put with the other eatables on the tiny table leaves that they propped up on
both sides of the centerboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along now, you aristocrats,&#8221; called out Teddy, &#8220;and
profit by the labor of us poor working men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind was steady, so that Lester could fasten his tiller while Fred
hitched the sail rope round a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_134'></a>134</span> cleat. Then they crowded into the little cabin and
passed judgment on the dinner. That it was a favorable one was shown by the
magical rapidity with which every crumb disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;No dyspeptics in this crowd,&#8221; laughed Fred, when the board had
been swept clean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so that you could notice it,&#8221; returned Bill. &#8220;A doctor
would starve to death if he had to depend on our patronage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My belt is so tight that it hurts,&#8221; admitted Teddy, loosening it
a few holes.</p>

<p>They lay around lazily for a few minutes, too happy and satisfied to move.
Then Fred and Lester resumed their places, while the other two drew a bucket of
water and washed the dishes and pans. This done, they slumped down comfortably
in the stern, watching the body of the shark that lunged along clumsily in the
wake of the <i>Ariel</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has an open countenance, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; grinned Teddy, as
they caught an occasional glimpse of the huge mouth on the under side of the
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;And look at those teeth,&#8221; shivered Bill. &#8220;They say that an
alligator&#8217;s jaw snaps shut with the power of fifteen hundred pounds. But
I&#8217;ll bet that the alligator has nothing on the shark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Teddy. &#8220;Those jaws
would cut a man&#8217;s leg off as neatly as if it were done with a
razor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>&#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t like to have him practise on me,&#8221; said Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that fellow ever had a toothache, it would be some ache,&#8221; put
in Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care to be the dentist that had the job of pulling
one of them,&#8221; laughed Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the patient would be a
little peevish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d get my assistant to pump a ton of chloroform in him
first,&#8221; declared Fred. &#8220;And even then I&#8217;d want to get into a
suit of armor before I operated on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder the sailors hate the brutes,&#8221; mused Teddy, as he
thought of the poor fellows who had been devoured by the monsters.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one of them knows but that he may be the next,&#8221; added
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sailors get even whenever they have the chance,&#8221; chimed in
Lester. &#8220;The minute they see any of the beasts near the ship, they trail a
hook over the stern in the hope of catching him. Sailors are superstitious, and
they believe that as long as a shark is in sight some one on board is doomed to
die. So they try to kill the hoodoo, by putting the shark out of
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing to feel a good deck beneath your feet, when a
shark heaves in sight,&#8221; remarked Bill. &#8220;Even in a boat no bigger
than the <i>Ariel</i>, we&#8217;re reasonably safe. But think of what it must be
like to be on an open raft on the ocean with a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_136'></a>136</span> crowd of these hungry pirates swimming all around
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And flinging themselves half way across the raft sometimes, trying to
upset it,&#8221; added Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be something fearful,&#8221; agreed Lester. &#8220;But there
are some people who are not afraid to meet the shark on its own ground&#8211;if
one can call water ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must take a lot of nerve,&#8221; declared Teddy. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to take their job away from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it takes a lot of nerve,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;It
takes a heap of skill too. No one could do it, if he couldn&#8217;t swim just
about as well as the shark himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad has told me of what he has seen with his own eyes. A native of
some of the South Sea Islands, when he learns from a fisherman that a shark is
cruising around, will take his knife between his teeth, slip into the water and
swim out to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the shark is looking for him too and can smell him, it isn&#8217;t
long before they come together. The native knows when the shark is coming by the
fin that shows above the surface, and when the shark gets close the native dives
under.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you know that the shark has to turn over on his back in
order to bite. The second it takes to do this has saved the life of many a poor
fellow, and it is that that gives the diver his chance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>&#8220;The
instant the shark turns over, the native plunges his knife into its stomach. He
knows just where to aim, and that one stroke usually does the business. If not,
he tries it again until the shark is killed. But everything has to be timed to a
second. The least little slip, and it&#8217;s all up with the native.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think there&#8217;d sometimes be a chance of meeting a school
of sharks instead of a single one,&#8221; commented Bill. &#8220;What would the
native do in that case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That does happen sometimes, but it doesn&#8217;t worry the South Sea
Islander much,&#8221; explained Lester. &#8220;He can usually keep the sharks
off by shouting and splashing. Then, too, if he kills one of them the others are
attracted by the blood of their comrade, and they tear him to pieces, while the
native swims back home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice lot of cannibals those sharks are, to prey upon each
other,&#8221; said Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like a pack of wolves,&#8221; agreed Lester. &#8220;Let one of
them be wounded, and the others tear him into bits. These wolves of the sea do
the same thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad says that sometimes the native won&#8217;t even take a knife, but
will just carry with him a stick of hard wood, sharpened at both ends. When the
shark turns over to nab him, the native thrusts the stick crosswise between the
open jaws. They close down on it, the points sink in so far that the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> shark can&#8217;t shut
its mouth, and the water flows in and chokes it to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems funny to choke a fish to death with water,&#8221; laughed
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of thrusting your arm into jaws like that,&#8221; said Bill.
&#8220;If the stick didn&#8217;t go straight up and down&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;d be a one-armed native,&#8221; Lester grimly completed
the sentence. &#8220;But here&#8217;s a boat coming up this way, and we&#8217;ve
been so busy chinning that we hadn&#8217;t noticed it. What do you make her out
to be, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t any sail,&#8221; pronounced Bill after a brief
scrutiny. &#8220;Here, hand me those glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a motor boat,&#8221; he announced a moment later,
&#8220;and she&#8217;s coming straight for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A motor boat!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy. &#8220;Do you think it can be
Ross?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than likely,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;But
he&#8217;ll be near enough in a few minutes for us to make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat drew rapidly nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who it is,&#8221; cried Teddy jubilantly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Ross and the <i>Sleuth</i>. Now we can compare notes about the
chest of gold!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>TOWING THE PRIZE</span></h2>

<p>The boys forgot all about the shark for the time, and their thoughts went
with redoubled intensity toward the object of their search, the missing
treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;ll be in a more talkative humor now than he was
when we saw him last?&#8221; mused Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;He&#8217;s had time to think us
over and size us up, and he may decide to make a clean breast of all he
knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuming that he really does know more than he has told us,&#8221;
remarked Bill, the skeptic. &#8220;We fellows may have drawn wrong conclusions
from the start he gave and that exception of his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, at any rate, we know a great deal more than we did when we saw
him last,&#8221; declared Teddy. &#8220;We know for a certainty many things that
he only guessed, especially that partial confession of Dick&#8217;s as to the
way Mr. Montgomery met his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had had time to hear from Uncle <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> Aaron,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He may
be able to give us some pointers, though I don&#8217;t suppose he knows much
outside of the fact that he loaned Mr. Montgomery money and didn&#8217;t get it
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m banking a good deal more on Mark Taylor than I am on what
your uncle may know,&#8221; said Lester, &#8220;although of course we may get
nothing from either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think we&#8217;d better do in regard to Ross?&#8221; asked
Teddy. &#8220;Tell him right off what we know, or wait for him to tell us
everything first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that instead of trying to wait or to swap, we&#8217;d better
be perfectly frank,&#8221; advised Fred. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a bit suspicious
now, he&#8217;ll grow more so if he thinks we&#8217;re trying any kind of a
game. Confidence breeds confidence, and we&#8217;ll set him the
example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that will be the better way,&#8221; acquiesced Lester.
&#8220;After all, he&#8217;s got so much more at stake than we have in this
matter that we shouldn&#8217;t blame him for being a little cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time it was evident that Ross had recognized them, for he was
standing up, waving at them vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to be glad to see us,&#8221; remarked Teddy, as the boys waved
back. &#8220;I take that as a good sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello Ross,&#8221; they yelled over the water when he got within
earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, yourselves,&#8221; the boy in the motor boat <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span> shouted eagerly in
reply. &#8220;What good wind blew you up to meet me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good engine drove you down to meet us?&#8221; Teddy flung back at
him with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on my way down to pay you a little visit at the Shoals,&#8221;
replied Ross. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to get over there so
soon. But when I got back to Oakland I found a letter from my mother saying she
had been delayed in starting, and wouldn&#8217;t be here for three or four days
yet. So I thought I&#8217;d scoot over and make hay while the sun
shone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be bully,&#8221; said Lester warmly. &#8220;Dad will be
glad to see you, and I hope you&#8217;ll be able to stay with us at the Shoals
until you have to meet your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better and it&#8217;s good of you to ask
me,&#8221; responded Ross. &#8220;But where are you fellows bound for
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going up to Milton on an errand that will interest you,
when we get time to tell you about it. Come right along with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing. I&#8217;ll just round to under your stern and we&#8217;ll
travel up alongside.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started his engine going, and then for the first time he noticed the huge
bulk that was trailing along in the wake of the <i>Ariel</i>.</p>

<p>He gave a startled shout, while the boys viewed his astonishment with
expressive grins.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shark!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_142'></a>142</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; said Fred.
&#8220;And for all we know it may be the same fellow that might have bitten us
in two the other day. What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a monster!&#8221; ejaculated Ross, who seemed unable to
believe his eyes. &#8220;Do you really mean that you fellows hooked and killed
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the fellow that gave him the finishing touch with his
little harpoon,&#8221; affirmed Teddy, indicating Lester.</p>

<p>Ross circled about the body, viewing it from every side.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been a terror when he was alive!&#8221; he exclaimed with
a shiver. &#8220;Even now, I&#8217;d feel a little nervous if I fell in
alongside of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s good and dead all right,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;Teddy
and I have been watching him for the last half hour, and he hasn&#8217;t made a
movement. That harpoon knew its business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with him?&#8221; asked Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll tow him up to Milton and land him on the beach,&#8221;
replied Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a better chance to look him over
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to get some souvenirs from him before we cast him away
altogether,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might get enough teeth to make a necklace and go strutting around
like a cannibal king,&#8221; grinned Bill. &#8220;I hear that those ornaments
make <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span> a great hit
with the dudes of the South Sea Islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d go well with that bunch of rattles we brought back from
the ranch this summer,&#8221; laughed Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if mother sees them first,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;She was half
scared to death when we brought home those rattles, and we had all we could do
to get her to let us keep them. Even as it is, they have to be kept out of
sight, and to bring home some shark&#8217;s teeth would be the finishing
touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut a strip of the hide to make a belt,&#8221;
declared Bill. &#8220;They say they last forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hat band for mine,&#8221; voted Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;A watch case will hit me hardest,&#8221; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty to go round, I guess,&#8221; laughed Ross.
&#8220;From the size of that fellow, you could cut out enough hide to make all
the belts and other gewgaws that could be used if you lived to be as old as
Methuselah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along now, fellows,&#8221; called out Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have plenty of time for a gab-fest when we get to Milton. We want to be getting
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about taking off some of your passengers, Lester?&#8221;
volunteered Ross. &#8220;That carcass makes a big weight for you to pull, and I
can just as well take two of you aboard as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; agreed Lester. &#8220;Take Bill and
Teddy. They&#8217;re no earthly good here anyway. Fred and I are doing all the
work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;I like
that,&#8221; replied Teddy in mock indignation. &#8220;Who was it that got up a
dinner that was good enough, I notice, for you fellows to stow away in a
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t because it was so good that we bolted it,&#8221;
chaffed Fred. &#8220;It was a disagreeable duty and we wanted to get it over
with as soon as we could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Ted,&#8221; said Bill with dignity, &#8220;and don&#8217;t
bandy words with those common sailors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only that I wanted to lift them up to our own level,&#8221;
rejoined Teddy. &#8220;But I guess you&#8217;re right, Bill. They can&#8217;t
appreciate the value of our companionship, and we&#8217;ll leave them to herd
together. They&#8217;ve had their chance, and there&#8217;s no use our wasting
time trying to make them into human beings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross brought the <i>Sleuth</i> alongside and the two boys leaped aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the shark too, if you want me to,&#8221; proposed
Ross. &#8220;I guess my engine could stand the strain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; replied Lester. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got two
sharks on board now, and I guess that&#8217;ll be all you can manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boats fell apart and the lightening of the <i>Ariel&#8217;s</i> load
showed results at once as the little boat leaped through the water at a
quickened pace. Ross dropped away to a distance of perhaps a hundred feet, in
order that the <i>Ariel</i> might have plenty of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span> sea room, and with their noses pointed
toward Milton the two craft went on in company.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much further have we got to go?&#8221; asked Fred, as he let out
the sheet in order to get every ounce of wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than eight miles, I reckon,&#8221; answered Lester.</p>

<p>He looked over the side to gauge the speed at which they were traveling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ten-knot breeze,&#8221; he conjectured, &#8220;and if we
didn&#8217;t have that ugly customer in the rear to tow along, we&#8217;d make
it in less than an hour. But even as it is, we&#8217;ll surely do it in an hour
and a half.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the wind freshened and cut some time off their schedule, so that it was
only a little over an hour when Lester gave a turn to the tiller that swung the
<i>Ariel</i> in toward the coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Milton,&#8221; he said, pointing to a tiny village of
small, straggling houses that came down close to the beach, &#8220;but we
don&#8217;t go so far as that. Mark lives in a little hut about a mile this side
of the town. Take the glasses and you can make it out. It stands all by itself
and you can&#8217;t miss it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred pointed the binoculars in the direction that Lester indicated and
plainly saw a shack near the edge of the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see any one about the cabin?&#8221; asked Lester.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;No, I
don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied his companion. &#8220;The door is open though, and
he may be inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove anything,&#8221; laughed Lester. &#8220;Mark
hasn&#8217;t anything worth stealing, and I guess the door&#8217;s open all the
time except in winter. But it won&#8217;t be long now before we find
out.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SPOILS OF WAR</span></h2>

<p>Just where the cabin stood was a little bay formed by an inward bend of the
coast, and in this the water was comparatively smooth.</p>

<p>Lester headed his boat into this and Ross, who took his sailing directions
from the <i>Ariel</i>, followed his example.</p>

<p>A hundred yards from shore, Fred ran down the sail and the boat drifted in
with its own momentum, while Lester took soundings cautiously to find the best
place to cast anchor. The <i>Ariel</i> was of light draught, and, with the
centerboard up, found three feet of water ample to prevent her scraping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; Lester said at last, when the two boats had
reached a suitable spot and he could see the sandy bottom through the clear
water. &#8220;Heave over the anchor now, and you fellows stand ready to go
overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys followed his directions, and a moment later all were in the
water.</p>

<p>Lester had previously unfastened the line by which they had been towing the
shark and thrown it over to Fred, who stood the nearest to the shore. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> The rest ranged
themselves along the line at intervals and bent their backs to the strain.</p>

<p>For strain it proved to be. While the huge carcass was floating clear of the
bottom it was comparatively easy to draw him along; but when the lower part
began to scrape, it was a more difficult matter. They progressed only an inch at
a time. By taking advantage of the rollers, however, as they came tumbling in,
the boys finally got their booty to the edge of the water line. They could not
drag it entirely clear of the water, but got it half way out, the head and upper
part of the body remaining exposed, while the tail swished idly to and fro in
the shallow water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Teddy, wiping his streaming forehead. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t like to work so hard as that every day in the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to,&#8221; remarked Lester, comfortingly.
&#8220;Lightning doesn&#8217;t strike twice in the same place, and the chances
are that you&#8217;ll never catch a shark again in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as a shark never catches me, I won&#8217;t kick,&#8221; said
the philosophical Bill.</p>

<p>They threw themselves down on the beach, panting and perspiring. The day was
very warm, and the excitement of the catch, together with their recent efforts,
made the rest a needed and grateful one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lester, the first to get on his feet <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span> again, &#8220;while you
weary Willies are loafing here, I&#8217;m going up to Mark&#8217;s cabin and see
if he&#8217;s at home. The chances are that he isn&#8217;t, or he&#8217;d have
been out to see what all this fuss was about. Still, he may be asleep. Anyway,
whether he&#8217;s home or not, I want to scare up an axe or hatchet or
something of the kind to dig out that harpoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the hatchet we&#8217;ve got?&#8221; asked
Teddy lazily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather small, and, besides, with that only one can work
at a time. It&#8217;ll take some digging to get through that hide. Then, too,
you fellows were talking of getting out the teeth and strips of the hide for
mementoes, and you can&#8217;t do that with your pocket knives alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on then, you horny-handed son of toil, and luck be with you,&#8221;
drawled Bill. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find us here when you get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of that,&#8221; retorted Lester. &#8220;It would take
an earthquake to make you fellows move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lester went up the beach until he reached the open door of the cabin and
looked in. He found it deserted as he had expected. He went in and hunted about
among its meagre belongings and came back to the boys, triumphant, bringing with
him a hatchet, an axe and a large, keen-bladed knife that was used by Mark in
cleaning his fish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he laid them down on the sand.
&#8220;Mark wasn&#8217;t at home, so I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span> made free with these things of his, as I knew he
wouldn&#8217;t mind. There&#8217;s no further excuse for you hoboes now, and you
want to get a wiggle on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take back them cruel woids,&#8221; groaned Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the chant of the slave driver!&#8221; jibed Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing left but to obey, shipmates,&#8221; said Fred
with mock resignation. &#8220;Remember he&#8217;s the captain and we don&#8217;t
want to be tried for mutiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>They distributed the implements among them and moved in a body toward the
shark.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to get out the harpoon, and this was no easy task,
for the barb of the shank lay deeply imbedded among the tough fibres of its
victim. The implement was freed at last, however, and Lester carefully washed it
off in the water and then polished it with sand until it shone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just see him gloat,&#8221; laughed Teddy. &#8220;You&#8217;d think he
was a pilgrim who had just come across a precious relic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or a miner who had found a diamond,&#8221; added Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s earned the right to gloat,&#8221; maintained Fred.
&#8220;If I&#8217;d driven home a harpoon with such a sure hand and steady aim
as his, I&#8217;d be so proud that my hat wouldn&#8217;t fit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking as much of dad as I am of myself,&#8221; grinned
Lester. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be tickled to death <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_151'></a>151</span> when he hears that I&#8217;ve speared a shark with
that old harpoon of his. He&#8217;s always thought a lot of it, but he&#8217;ll
think still more of it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that the harpoon is out, let&#8217;s turn this fellow on his
back. I want to have a good look at that mouth of his,&#8221; remarked Fred.</p>

<p>It was quite an undertaking, but by distributing themselves along the body,
using their implements as levers and all heaving at a given signal, they finally
succeeded.</p>

<p>It was a frightful mouth, armed with huge rows of sawlike teeth, and although
they knew the brute was dead the boys could not repress a shudder as they looked
at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about a buzz saw!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy. &#8220;It
couldn&#8217;t cut you in two more neatly than this fellow could when he was
swimming around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If those teeth could talk, I imagine they&#8217;d have some stories to
tell,&#8221; added Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they wouldn&#8217;t be pretty stories either,&#8221; observed
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want him to be the undertaker at my funeral,&#8221;
said Fred, who could not help thinking that that dismal function might have been
performed by this shark or some other the day he had gone overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at those wicked eyes,&#8221; said Lester. &#8220;They&#8217;re
almost as fiendish now as they were when they looked up at us as he came
swimming around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
the boat. I&#8217;ll wager we&#8217;ll see them more than once in our
dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as we don&#8217;t see them any other way it won&#8217;t matter
much,&#8221; concluded Bill, the practical.</p>

<p>It was a full hour before the boys had cut the teeth from the bony sockets
and had secured all the strips of hide they wanted to make up into
souvenirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave the rest of the carcass here until the tide comes in
and carries it away,&#8221; remarked Lester, when the work was finished.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll float out to sea and the other fish will make short work of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be only justice,&#8221; said Teddy. &#8220;He&#8217;s
feasted on them or their brothers by the ton in his time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gulls will help them out,&#8221; said Lester, as he pointed to a
number of the great birds circling around. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting ready
now to pick the bones, and are only waiting for us to get out of the way before
they settle down to the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting pretty late, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; inquired Bill.
&#8220;I hardly think we&#8217;ll see Bartanet Shoals again to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a chance in the world,&#8221; replied Lester, as he looked at the
sky, already crimsoning in the west. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to stay all night
with Mark and make a break for home in the morning. But it doesn&#8217;t <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> matter, and dad
won&#8217;t be worrying about us this time, especially if the weather stays
clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Mark will find it some job to put us up for the
night,&#8221; observed Ross, as he noted the tiny dimensions of the little cabin
on the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly a summer hotel,&#8221; grinned Lester.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one room and that&#8217;s pretty well cluttered up
with his nets and tackle and other junk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably have to sleep outside on the sand,&#8221;
remarked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more fun,&#8221; chimed in Teddy. &#8220;We&#8217;ve done it
once and we can do it again. One thing sure, there won&#8217;t be any kick
coming on the question of ventilation. The earth for a bed, the sky for a
blanket&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the sea for a lullaby,&#8221; finished Ross.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE EMPTY HUT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the poets,&#8221; jibed Bill. &#8220;Homer and Milton have
nothing on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind his knocking, Ross,&#8221; said Teddy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s only envious because he can&#8217;t rise to our heights.
He&#8217;s like that fellow that Wordsworth tells us about:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A primrose by the river&#8217;s brim<br /> A yellow primrose was to
him<br /> And nothing more.&#8217;&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;Well, what more was it?&#8221; grinned Bill, stubbornly holding his
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hopeless case,&#8221; groaned Teddy. &#8220;If he heard a bobolink
singing, he&#8217;d ask whether it was good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this anyway?&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;It sounds like
elocution day at Rally Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about eats,&#8221; chimed in Lester, &#8220;what&#8217;s the
matter with getting our stuff off the boat before it gets dark? Mark will have
plenty of fish with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_155'></a>155</span> him when he gets back, and with what we can supply
we ought to be able to get up a nifty little supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me in on this,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got quite a
cargo of supplies on the <i>Sleuth</i>, and we&#8217;ll all chip in
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more the merrier,&#8221; cried Lester, accepting the offer.
&#8220;I imagine Mark doesn&#8217;t have much variety in his diet, and
we&#8217;ll see that to-night at least the old man has a bang-up
meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that the way to a man&#8217;s heart is through his
stomach,&#8221; observed Teddy, &#8220;and if we fill him up, he&#8217;ll be all
the more ready to loosen up and tell us all he knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had a Chinaman along,&#8221; remarked Fred.
&#8220;We&#8217;d get him to make us a soup out of the shark&#8217;s
fins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it ourselves if we get hard up,&#8221; laughed Ross,
&#8220;but it seems to me we&#8217;ve got our money&#8217;s worth out of the
shark already, without taxing him any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waded out to the boats and ransacked the lockers, returning loaded with
coffee and bacon and beans and eggs and jams, the sight of which added a spur to
their already lively appetites.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks like Mark&#8217;s boat out there now,&#8221; observed
Lester, as he straightened up and surveyed the sea.</p>

<p>He pointed to a tiny catboat coming in at a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_156'></a>156</span> spanking gait, and that seemed to be headed
directly for that part of the beach where the boys stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the rate he&#8217;s coming, he&#8217;ll be here in fifteen
minutes,&#8221; Lester announced a moment later.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with having supper all ready when the old man
gets in?&#8221; chuckled Fred. &#8220;It&#8217;ll pay for using his tools, and
it will give him the surprise of his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good thing!&#8221; exclaimed Lester heartily. &#8220;The poor old chap
doesn&#8217;t get many surprises&#8211;pleasant ones I mean&#8211;and it will
warm his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To say nothing of his stomach,&#8221; added the ever practical
Bill.</p>

<p>The boys set to work with a zest, and five pairs of hands transformed the
interior of the little hut in a twinkling. Fred lighted a fire in the rusty
stove, Bill cut up some wood for fuel, Ross brought water for the coffee from a
neighboring spring, Teddy cleared the litter of odds and ends off the rough pine
table and set out the eatables, while Lester fried the bacon, warmed the beans
and made the coffee. Everything, even down to salt and sugar, had come from
their own stores, so that Mark&#8217;s meagre stock was not drawn upon for
anything. A fluffy omelet finished Lester&#8217;s part of the work, and when
Ross produced a big apple pie that his landlady had given him to take along that
morning, the boys stood off and viewed their handiwork with pride.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;It makes
one&#8217;s mouth water,&#8221; said Teddy, who claimed to be an expert where
food was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; declared Bill. &#8220;I wish Mark had
wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t need them,&#8221; replied Lester, looking out of the
door, &#8220;for here he comes now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys ran out to greet the returning master of the house, who had rounded
the point into the sheltered bay and was fast approaching the beach. He had
already noticed the two boats lying side by side and surmised that he had
visitors. He looked at the boys curiously and waved his hand to Lester in
friendly fashion.</p>

<p>Then his boat claimed all his attention. With surprising agility for one so
old, he did all that was necessary to lay it up snugly for the night. Then he
clambered into a small rowboat that trailed at the stern, loosed the rope that
held it and with a few deft pulls at the oars rowed in until he grounded on the
beach. The boys ran forward and drew the boat far up on the sands above the high
water mark, while Lester shook hands with the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Mark?&#8221; he said heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How be yer, Les?&#8221; responded the other with no less cordiality,
&#8220;an&#8217; how&#8217;s yer pa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s all right and so am I,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;You
see I&#8217;ve brought a bunch of my friends over to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it kindly of yer,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;I get a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span> leetle lonesome here all
by myself, an&#8217; it heartens me up a bit ter git a sight of young critters.
Out on a fishin&#8217; trip, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had crowded round them by this time, and Lester introduced them to
the old fisherman, who shook hands heartily, albeit rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lester, when this ceremony was finished, answering
Mark&#8217;s last question, &#8220;we are on a fishing trip, but we&#8217;re
fishing for information more than for anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Information?&#8221; repeated Mark, taken a little aback.
&#8220;Waal,&#8221; he said, recovering himself, &#8220;ef there&#8217;s
anythin&#8217; I know, yer welcome ter have it. What is it yer want ter
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of things,&#8221; laughed Lester. &#8220;But they can wait till
after supper. By the way, Mark, I suppose you&#8217;ll let us stay to supper? I
know it&#8217;s awfully nervy to plump ourselves down on you this way without
any warning and without being invited. But if you can take care of us for the
night and give us a bite to eat, we&#8217;ll be mighty thankful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I will,&#8221; replied Mark warmly. &#8220;But yer&#8217;ll have
ter take pot luck. Come up ter the cabin an&#8217; I&#8217;ll hunt yer up a
snack of sumthin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had been standing between him and their catch of the morning, but as
they separated to go up to the shack he caught sight of the stranded body of the
shark. He stopped short in amazement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span>&#8220;Sufferin&#8217; cats!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;Where in the world did that thing come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t come of his own accord,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;We
picked him up and brought him along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do yer mean ter tell me that you youngsters caught him all by
yerselves?&#8221; asked Mark, looking from one to the other in incredulous
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we did,&#8221; replied Teddy. &#8220;That is, we all
had a part in hooking him, and then Lester, here, finished the job with his
father&#8217;s harpoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Les, ye&#8217;re a chip of the old block,&#8221; cried Mark
delightedly. &#8220;Yer pa was one of the best harpooners thet ever sailed from
these parts an&#8217; ye sure have got his blood in yer ter do a man-sized job
like this. A mighty good job it is too, fer I don&#8217;t know when these
fellers has been more troublesome than they&#8217;ve been this year, what with
sp&#8217;ilin&#8217; the nets an&#8217; scarin&#8217; away the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked around the body, giving vent to muttered exclamations of wonder and
satisfaction, and the boys had a chance to study him more closely than they had
yet been able to do.</p>

<p>He was a wizened, dried-up little man, not much more than five feet in
height. His shoulders were bent with the infirmities of age&#8211;they judged
him to be over seventy&#8211;but his movements were spry, and they had already
seen by the way he handled his boat that he was not lacking in dexterity. There
was a suspicious redness about his nose that was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> explained by Lester&#8217;s hint about
his fondness for a certain black bottle. But his eyes were friendly and free
from guile, and the simple cordiality with which he had welcomed them to his
scanty fare showed that his heart was kindly.</p>

<p>He found it hard to tear himself away from gloating over the body of the
shark&#8211;the shark he hated with the hatred of all the members of his
calling&#8211;but he recalled himself at last to the duties of hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I swan!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;Here I am wastin&#8217;
time on this cantankerous old pirate when I ought ter be hustlin&#8217; around
ter get you boys some grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys could see a growing perplexity in the old fellow&#8217;s kindly face
as he tried to think how to feed such a hungry crew as he saw about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, anything will do,&#8221; Lester hastened to assure him.
&#8220;Come along up to the cabin and we&#8217;ll pitch in and help.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the door, and as Mark&#8217;s eyes fell upon the crowded table,
and as the fragrant odor of the coffee and the other good things assailed his
nostrils, he gave vent to an exclamation of astonishment and relief that was
lost in the roar of laughter that burst from the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I vum!&#8221; he exclaimed as soon as he could catch his
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some surprise party, eh Mark?&#8221; asked Lester.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>&#8220;Yer could
knock me down with a feather,&#8221; the old fisherman replied. &#8220;An&#8217;
me a-rackin&#8217; my old noddle as ter how I was goin&#8217; ter giv&#8217; ye
anythin&#8217; but fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to taste of fish to-night,&#8221; stated
Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, that won&#8217;t be no loss,&#8221; grinned Mark delightedly.
&#8220;I eat so much fish that I&#8217;m expectin&#8217; almost any minnit
I&#8217;ll be sproutin&#8217; fins an&#8217; gills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This treat is all on us,&#8221; affirmed Fred, &#8220;and all you have
to do is to fill up on what you see before you and tell us what you think of our
cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that right enough,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;an&#8217; ef
it tastes as good as it smells an&#8217; looks, there ain&#8217;t one of you
youngsters that will stow away more than I kin.&#8221;</p>

<p>They installed him at the head of the table in the one chair that the cabin
boasted, while they disposed themselves around on boxes and whatever else would
serve as seats. Their surroundings were of the rudest kind but the fare was
ample and their appetites keen and there was an atmosphere of mirth and high
spirits that made full amends for whatever was lacking in the way of what Teddy
called frills. Mark renewed his youth in the unaccustomed company of so many
young lads, and ate as he had not eaten for many a day or year.</p>

<p>They did not broach the object of their visit until the meal was finished and
the remnants cleared <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_162'></a>162</span> away. Then they adjourned to the beach in front of
the cabin, where Mark filled his pipe and tilted back in his chair against the
front of the shack, while the boys threw themselves down on the sand around
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mark,&#8221; began Lester, when, with his pipe drawing well, the
old fisherman beamed on them all in rare good humor, &#8220;I suppose
you&#8217;ve been wondering what we mean by coming down and taking you by storm
in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter be taken by storm that way a mighty sight oftener
than I be,&#8221; returned Mark. &#8220;But sence yer speak of it, I am a leetle
mite curious as ter what yer wanted with an old fisherman like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about something that happened nine or ten years ago,&#8221;
went on Lester. &#8220;Do you remember the time you picked up a man in an open
boat off this coast somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark was attentive in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgit it,&#8221; he declared emphatically. &#8220;I
never was so sorry fur a feller-bein&#8217; in all my life as I was fur
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is his son,&#8221; said Lester, indicating Ross.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>BITS OF EVIDENCE</span></h2>

<p>If Mark had received a shock from a galvanic battery he would not have been
more startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221; he demanded, bringing his chair down
from its tilted position and looking around upon the group in a bewildered
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester is right,&#8221; said Ross, who had risen to his feet and
stretched out his hand. &#8220;My name is Ross Montgomery, and I want to thank
you with all my heart for what you did for my father. I&#8217;ve never had the
chance to do it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was shaken with emotion at this meeting with the man who had played
so large a part in the tragedy of his family so many years before.</p>

<p>Mark grasped the extended hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was your pa that I picked up that day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
hed a sort of feelin&#8217; to-day that I had seen you somewheres, an&#8217; I
s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s because you favored him some. You have the same kind of hair
an&#8217; eyes, as near as I kin rec&#8217;lect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I was only a little chap when it all <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span> happened,&#8221; said Ross, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ve often heard mother tell how kind you were to him after you found him
adrift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! that was nothin&#8217;,&#8221; replied Mark deprecatingly,
as he resumed his seat. &#8220;I only did fur him what any man would do fur
an&#8217; unfo&#8217;tunit feller-man. He was nearly all gone when I come across him.
The doc said he would &#8217;a&#8217; died ef he&#8217;d floated around a few
hours longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember anything he said to you while you were taking care of
him?&#8221; asked Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he said a heap o&#8217; things, jest like any man does when he is
out of his head,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t pay much attention
like. I was too busy holdin&#8217; him down when he got vi&#8217;lent, as he did
pretty often the first few days. After that he kind of settled down an&#8217;
only kep&#8217; a-mutterin&#8217; to himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but didn&#8217;t he say anything that would give you a hint of
what had happened to him and how he came to be adrift?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>Mark ruminated for a full minute, evidently doing his best to tax his
memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got the best memory in the world,&#8221; he said
apologetically, &#8220;an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t make out fur certain all he
said. But I got the idee thet there&#8217;d been a fight of some kind an&#8217;
thet he&#8217;d lost a pile of money. He kep&#8217; a talkin&#8217; of
&#8216;gold&#8217; an&#8217; some &#8216;debts&#8217; he owed. Course I thought it was only
the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> ravin&#8217;s
of a crazy man an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t take much stock in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there anything else?&#8221; prodded Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; replied Mark hesitatingly, &#8220;nothin&#8217; thet I
remember on. Oh, yes,&#8221; he went on, as a sudden flash of memory came to
him, &#8220;I do rec&#8217;lect he kep&#8217; sayin&#8217;: &#8216;It&#8217;s where the
water&#8217;s comin&#8217; in.&#8217; But of course there wasn&#8217;t no sense
in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys sat up straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that again, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where the water&#8217;s comin&#8217; in,&#8221; repeated
Mark. &#8220;He said that over and over. I s&#8217;pose it was the feelin&#8217; of
the spray thet came over him in the boat. I don&#8217;t rightly know what else
it could have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boys themselves turned the phrase over in their minds, they could not
see how it bore on the object of their search. They filed it away in their minds
to think about later on.</p>

<p>For the next two hours they discussed the matter with Mark, trying to get
from him any little shred of evidence that would be of help, and yet at the same
time guarding carefully against revealing the real object of their questioning.
He, for his part, set it down to the natural curiosity they felt in an event
that touched the life of one of them so nearly, and did his best to cudgel his
memory. But nothing more came of it than they had already learned, and it was
with a sense of depression and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_166'></a>166</span> failure that they finally gave up the cross
examination that they had come so far to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mark,&#8221; said Lester at last, when several long yawns had
shown that the old man was tired and sleepy, &#8220;we can&#8217;t tell you how
much obliged we are to you for all you&#8217;ve told us. But I guess we&#8217;ve
tired you out with all our questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; denied Mark valiantly, though his drooping
eyelids belied his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just a-wonderin&#8217; where I was goin&#8217; to put all you
boys for the night,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one bed in the
cabin, but I kin spread some blankets on the floor, ef that&#8217;ll do
yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry at all about that,&#8221; said Fred cheerily.
&#8220;You go right in to bed and we&#8217;ll bunk out here on the beach.
It&#8217;s a warm night, and we&#8217;d as soon do it as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there was really nothing else to do, Mark, after making a feeble protest,
said good-night and went inside, while the boys moved down the beach until they
were out of earshot and prepared to camp out.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t get much out of the old chap after all, did we?&#8221;
said Bill rather despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;After coming all this way too,&#8221; added Teddy, even more
dejectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing we&#8217;ll have to show for the trip will be the
shark, I guess,&#8221; said Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that would be enough if we hadn&#8217;t gotten <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> anything else,&#8221;
declared Fred. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not so sure that we came on a fool&#8217;s
errand after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think we didn&#8217;t?&#8221; asked Bill. &#8220;What
do we know that we didn&#8217;t know before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; suggested Fred, &#8220;we hadn&#8217;t heard before of
that phrase Mr. Montgomery used over and over. &#8216;It&#8217;s where the
water&#8217;s coming in.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing at all,&#8221; affirmed Bill decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a hunch it does mean something,&#8221; replied Fred, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m going to keep mulling it over in my mind until I find out what the
meaning is.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Ross,&#8221; he went on, turning to their new-found friend
where he sat brooding a little way apart from the rest, &#8220;we&#8217;ve
learned something since we saw you first that may interest you. We&#8217;d have
told you earlier this afternoon, but we&#8217;ve been traveling in different
boats, and then when we got on shore we were so busy with cutting up the shark
that we didn&#8217;t get a chance till now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried, getting up and joining the group.</p>

<p>He listened breathlessly while Fred told him what they had learned during
their talk with Mr. Lee&#8211;the fight with the smugglers, their flight to the
south Pacific, the partial confession of Dick and the going down of the ship
with all on board.</p>

<p>When Fred had finished, Ross rose and paced the beach excitedly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;You
fellows found out in a few minutes what I&#8217;ve spent years trying to
learn,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;All the time I&#8217;ve been hunting, I&#8217;ve
been haunted by the fear that even if I found where the gold had been hidden,
the money would long ago have been taken and spent by the robbers. I&#8217;ve
felt like all kinds of an idiot in keeping up the search on such a slender
chance, and again and again I&#8217;ve been tempted to give it up. But this puts
new life and hope in me. There&#8217;s still a chance to find the gold and pay
my father&#8217;s debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s practically certain that the money is still there,&#8221;
affirmed Fred. &#8220;The fellows who took it are all drowned&#8211;unless
they&#8217;re living somewhere on a desert island, and that&#8217;s so unlikely
after all this time that it isn&#8217;t worth giving it a second thought. The
only living man, outside of ourselves, who knows about the gold is Tom Bixby.
He&#8217;s just a rough sailor knocking about all over the world, and he too may
be dead by this time. The whole secret lies with us, and if the gold&#8217;s
ever found, we&#8217;ll be the ones who will find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys have been perfect bricks,&#8221; declared Ross warmly,
&#8220;and you make me ashamed for having kept anything back from you from the
start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t feel that way at all,&#8221; asserted Teddy.
&#8220;For my part, I think you&#8217;ve been very generous and outspoken in
telling us as much as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_169'></a>169</span> you have. You&#8217;d never met us before that day
of the storm and didn&#8217;t know anything about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know all about you now,&#8221; declared Ross, &#8220;and from
now on, everything I find out will be known to you as fast as I can get it to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys said nothing but waited expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I didn&#8217;t tell you that first
night,&#8221; Ross continued. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how important it may
prove to be, but at least it&#8217;s a clue that may lead to something.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you know, the <i>Ranger</i> was taken to Halifax and abandoned
there by the smugglers. Ramsay, the captain who died on the trip, had owned it,
but he had no family and the authorities took charge of the boat and sold it
after a while, holding the money they got for it for the benefit of the heirs,
if any should ever turn up. The new owner used the boat for a voyage or two, but
he found it hard to get a crew. You know how superstitious sailors are. The
mysterious way it was found abandoned gave sailor men the impression that there
was a hoodoo of some kind connected with it, and they wouldn&#8217;t ship aboard
her. So the new owner sold it and the name was changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day in Canada I ran across a sailor who had made a trip in the
ship before the name was changed, and he told me a queer thing. He said he had
found a rough map cut out on the wood of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_170'></a>170</span> the forecastle with a jackknife. There were wavy
lines to represent the water and a shaded part that might stand for a beach.
Then there was a clump of three trees standing together, and a little way off
were two more. One big rock rose out of the water on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I jumped to the conclusion that it might have something to
do with the place where the gold was hidden. I thought perhaps some of the
sailors had wanted to impress on their memory just how the place looked, so that
they could find it more easily when the time came. I pumped the man for more
details, but that was all he could remember. I&#8217;ve tried in every way I
knew to trace the old <i>Ranger</i> but she has slipped out of sight like a
ghost. If I could only have one look at that old forecastle, I think that the
map might put me on the right trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it would,&#8221; declared Fred with conviction, and his
opinion was eagerly echoed by the others.</p>

<p>For a long time they debated the matter from this new angle, and it was very
late when Lester urged that they should settle down for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get an early start in the morning and get back to the
Shoals before noon,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I want to get busy on the
government maps and plot out every mile of the coast so that we can start out in
earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lester&#8217;s plan miscarried in part. They got <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span> the early start after a cordial
good-bye to Mark. But the wind was baffling and they had to make long tacks, so
that dusk was drawing on when they at last reached Bartanet Shoals.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANGRY WATERS</span></h2>

<p>As the five boys entered the lighthouse, Teddy happened to glance at the
barometer that was fastened to the wall near the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, fellows!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;the glass is certainly
mighty low this evening. Looks as though there might be some weather
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a peep,&#8221; responded Lester carelessly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re not due for any bad weather yet awhile, and I don&#8217;t
think&#8211;Whew! but it is low, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he exclaimed as he
examined the dial of the instrument. &#8220;There&#8217;s something on the way,
that&#8217;s sure. I don&#8217;t remember the barometer often getting quite as
low as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, let it come!&#8221; exclaimed Fred. &#8220;What do we care?
We won&#8217;t be out in the <i>Ariel</i> this time, and I guess it would take
some storm to wash this old lighthouse away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Lester. &#8220;I guess no storm that ever blew or
ever will blow can do us much damage. It is built on a ledge of solid bed rock,
and it would take an earthquake to shake it loose. We&#8217;ll <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span> be snug and safe enough,
no matter how hard it blows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case, bring on your show,&#8221; grinned Teddy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to see a first-class, bang-up storm, so you
can&#8217;t pile on the scenic effects too strong. Let&#8217;s have plenty of
wind and waves and all the rest of the fixings. Do a good job, while
you&#8217;re about it, Lester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judging from the looks of that barometer, I won&#8217;t have to do a
blessed thing,&#8221; replied Lester in the same tone of banter. &#8220;My stage
manager, old Father Neptune, is going to be right on the job, and when he gets
going I don&#8217;t feel called on to interfere. I&#8217;ve seen a few of his
performances and I must confess that I haven&#8217;t seen much room for
improvement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except,&#8221; he went on in a graver tone, &#8220;that if I had my
way, I&#8217;d leave some of the ships out of the production. After you&#8217;ve
once seen some big craft go to pieces on the shoals, you rather lose your liking
for the entertainment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose that&#8217;s so,&#8221; acquiesced Teddy, his usually
high spirits sobered for a moment by having this view of the case presented to
him. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that part of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Fred, &#8220;if there&#8217;s going to be a
storm, as seems pretty likely now, we&#8217;ll hope that nothing of the kind
occurs. After that stormy time we had on the <i>Ariel</i>, I can imagine pretty
well what <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> it must
feel like to be shipwrecked. When we were headed for those rocks, I expected to
be swimming for dear life in about two minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been rather bad, I suppose,&#8221; said Lester with a
smile. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so bad for me, because I had done the stunt before
and was sure I could do it again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is no time for talking,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Either
I&#8217;ve got to get something to eat pretty soon or else quietly give up the
ghost. I&#8217;m as hungry as a bear in spring time, and I&#8217;m willing to
bet something that you fellows feel the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You win,&#8221; admitted Fred. &#8220;But luckily for us it&#8217;s
near dinner time so we still have a chance to live awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry and clean up then before dad calls us to the
table.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Lester stopped speaking, a gust of wind tore past the lighthouse with a
mournful wail. The sound died down for a few seconds and then rose again in a
dismal, long-drawn-out note that caused the boys to give an involuntary
shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the beginning,&#8221; declared Lester. &#8220;It will
keep getting worse and worse, and after a while we&#8217;ll hardly be able to
hear each other speak. We&#8217;re in for a real blow this time I
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up into the light room and see what it looks like
outside,&#8221; suggested Fred. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span> dark fast and we&#8217;ll not be able
to see anything before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, come ahead,&#8221; agreed Lester.</p>

<p>He headed the group up the spiral stairs that led to the lamp room.</p>

<p>An early dusk had fallen over the heaving ocean, yet it was not so dark but
that they could see that the seas were rising rapidly. Here and there the big
waves were capped with white crests as they raced away before the spur of the
merciless wind. Already they were breaking against the rocks on which the
lighthouse stood with a heavy roar and a force that caused the building, stout
as it was, to tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is working up fast, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Teddy in a
subdued voice. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be out in it even now. And I suppose it
hasn&#8217;t really begun to get bad yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, it hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; assented Lester grimly.
&#8220;But now while we are up here, I&#8217;d better light the lamps. Then I
can go down and eat with an easy conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, he lit the wicks of the great lamps and, after assuring himself
that everything was in perfect order, he and the other boys descended to the
dining room. There they found everything in readiness and made one of the hearty
and satisfactory meals that the lighthouse larder never failed to afford.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>As they ate,
they could feel the building shake to the furious blasts that smote against it,
and Mr. Lee shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a wild night on the ocean, I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; he
remarked, &#8220;and we can thank our lucky stars that we&#8217;re all in a snug
shelter and well out of harm&#8217;s way. I feel sorry for those who have to be
abroad on the water to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; echoed Fred. &#8220;Just listen to that wind roar,
will you? It seems as though a million demons were yelling at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the ocean&#8217;s a good second,&#8221; chimed in Teddy.
&#8220;Wow!&#8221; he cried, as a giant breaker thundered down on the reef,
&#8220;that must have been the daddy of them all, I guess. Let&#8217;s go up to
the lookout room as soon as we&#8217;re through and watch the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boys were quite as eager as Teddy, and when they had finished their
meal they went up the stairs to what might be called the observation room. This
was situated just below the room in which the lamps were placed, and had windows
of thick glass facing the sea. A door led out from it on to a balcony that ran
completely around the structure. This door also faced the ocean, and Teddy,
always enterprising, thought that he would like to go out on the balcony to feel
the force of the wind.</p>

<p>He attempted to push the door open, but without success. He tried again, with
the same result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>&#8220;Guess the
old thing must be locked,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see the
key anywhere. Have you got it with you, Lester?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Lester, who had been watching Teddy&#8217;s
ineffectual efforts with a smile, &#8220;but that door isn&#8217;t locked. The
reason you couldn&#8217;t open it was because the wind was blowing so fiercely
against it. I doubt if the four of us put together could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder that I had trouble then. But never mind. The wind
can&#8217;t keep me from <i>looking</i> out, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shaded his eyes with his hands and peered through the thick plate glass
windows. The others followed his example, and saw a sight that they never
forgot.</p>

<p>The wind had piled the waves up higher and higher, until they looked like an
endless succession of undulating, constantly advancing hills and valleys. From
the ragged crests the spray was torn and blown in solid sheets before the raging
wind so that at times it was impossible to see the heaving waters beneath. As
the breakers came up against the lighthouse ledge, their tops would curve over
and come crashing down with mighty blows that it seemed must pulverize the solid
granite. The rebounding spray was snatched up by the gale and hurled against the
lighthouse, as though the elements were furious at this one obstacle that
prevented <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span> them
from wreaking their full rage on some unfortunate ship and were resolved to
sweep it from their path once and for all.</p>

<p>The boys gazed spellbound at the awe-inspiring spectacle, and for a time none
of them uttered a word. Lester was the first to break the long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anything better&#8211;or worse&#8211;than
this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess the barometer knew what it was doing
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely is a tremendous thing to watch,&#8221; assented Fred, and
again applied himself to the window, where the others kept their faces glued,
too fascinated with the elemental turmoil to think of anything else.</p>

<p>They tore themselves away at last and went up into the lamp room where Mr.
Lee was on duty.</p>

<p>He had just finished trimming the wicks when the boys entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of this for a storm?&#8221; he quizzed. &#8220;Is it
blowing hard enough to suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tremendous!&#8221; ejaculated Ross. &#8220;I never knew
that wind could blow so hard or waves get so big. It&#8217;s something to
remember for a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee smiled at his earnestness and nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well say so,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ve
seen worse winds in the tropics, when they developed into hurricanes or
typhoons. But for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
this coast, it doesn&#8217;t often blow harder. There&#8217;s more than one fine
ship will lay her bones down on some reef or beach this night.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Mr. Lee was speaking, the boys had noticed several dull blows against
the outside lens of the light, and Teddy took the first opportunity to inquire
the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s caused by sea-gulls and other water birds dashing
themselves against the light,&#8221; explained Lester. &#8220;They&#8217;re
driven by the wind, and are so confused and terrified that I don&#8217;t suppose
they know what they&#8217;re doing. Or perhaps the bright light has an
attraction for them. At any rate, they always do it in a big storm, and in large
numbers too. Why, in the morning we can go out and find hundreds of dead birds
where they&#8217;ve dropped at the base of the tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a shame!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy, who always had a tender place in
his heart for dumb creatures. &#8220;I suppose they don&#8217;t see the glass at
all, and think they can keep right on going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the way of it, I guess,&#8221; affirmed Mr. Lee.
&#8220;They come against the glass with such force sometimes that I&#8217;m
almost afraid they&#8217;ll break it. It&#8217;s too bad, but there&#8217;s no
help for it yet, though men are at work trying to find some device to prevent
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you think the storm will last?&#8221; inquired Fred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;Chances
are that it&#8217;ll last out all to-morrow,&#8221; answered their host,
&#8220;though it&#8217;s blowing so hard that it may blow itself out before
that. There&#8217;s no telling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a good chance to mend up our fishing tackle
then,&#8221; remarked Fred, &#8220;because it doesn&#8217;t look as though
there&#8217;d be much chance doing anything outdoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you find time hanging heavy on your hands,&#8221; observed Mr. Lee
with a sly twinkle in his eye, &#8220;you might get busy and clean out the
lamps. They&#8217;re about due for a good scouring, and it might help you to
pass away a long day indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s certainly a great idea,&#8221; said Lester reflectively,
&#8220;but there&#8217;s nothing in it for me. I&#8217;ve done it before and
there&#8217;s no novelty in it. But I&#8217;m sure that Teddy and Fred would
enjoy it immensely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; replied Teddy hastily. &#8220;Fred and I
aren&#8217;t going to come to see you, Lester, and then butt in on all your
simple pleasures. You just go ahead and enjoy yourself cleaning out the lamps,
just as though we weren&#8217;t around. We&#8217;ll manage to plug along some
way in the meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all laughed at this sally and shortly afterwards the boys took leave of
Mr. Lee and returned to the observation room. The wind roared and the ocean
boomed on the rocks with undiminished force, and they spent the rest of the
evening gazing out <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
through the streaming windows and wondering at the mighty spectacle spread out
before them.</p>

<p>At last Lester, to whom the fury of a storm was a more common thing than to
his companions, proposed that they go to bed, and they reluctantly tore
themselves away. The last thing the lads heard as they sank into dreamless
slumber was the crash of tumbling waves and the maddened shrieks of the wind as
it hurtled past the lighthouse.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNEXPECTED WINDFALL</span></h2>

<p>Dawn broke the following day without any sign of the storm&#8217;s abating,
and the boys were forced to keep close within doors. Despite their forced
imprisonment, time did not hang heavily, and they found plenty with which to
occupy their hands and minds.</p>

<p>Of course, all about the lighthouse was new to Ross, and he spent a good many
hours exploring its delightful mysteries under the guidance of Lester and Mr.
Lee himself, who had taken an instant liking to this new addition to his
household and had given him a most cordial welcome, not only on his own account,
but on account of his romantic story, which had appealed strongly to the old
man&#8217;s fancy and sympathy.</p>

<p>Bill busied himself with overhauling and getting into first-class shape his
fishing paraphernalia, and discharged a neglected duty in writing a long letter
to his mother, filled with enthusiastic descriptions of the glorious times he
was having, and dwelling most, as may be imagined, on the hooking of the shark
the day before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>Fred and Teddy
had been delighted to find letters waiting them from the family at home,
including one from their Uncle Aaron. They pounced upon the letters eagerly.
That from their mother, to which their father had added a few lines as
postscript, was full of pride at Fred&#8217;s exploit and delight at the
prospect opened up of being useful to their uncle in case they found the missing
gold.</p>

<p>Teddy tore open the letter which bore the precise handwriting of his uncle
with a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think, Fred, of opening a letter from Uncle Aaron that
doesn&#8217;t contain a scolding!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure,&#8221; laughed Fred. &#8220;Perhaps
he&#8217;ll scold you for not having found the chest, instead of telling him you
hoped to find it. Hello, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; as a blue slip fluttered out
from the envelope and fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Teddy was on it like a hawk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory, hallelujah!&#8221; he yelled, as he capered around the floor,
waving the paper in the air. &#8220;It&#8217;s a money order for fifty
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty dollars!&#8221; cried his brother in amazement. &#8220;Do you
mean to say that Uncle Aaron has loosened up as much as that? You must be
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight goods,&#8221; replied Teddy. &#8220;Look for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred scanned the paper. There was no mistake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;I take
back what I said about your being crazy,&#8221; Fred remarked, as he handed the
money order back, &#8220;but if you&#8217;re not, Uncle Aaron is. He must have
had a sudden attack of enlargement of the heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked over Teddy&#8217;s shoulder and they read the letter together. It
was written in their uncle&#8217;s customary style, except that it was tinctured
with a more cordial feeling than he usually displayed toward his nephews. He
spoke in terms of great respect of Mr. Montgomery and confirmed what the little
memorandum book had revealed as to the amount of the debt. He declared that if
the money was found he wanted nothing but the principal, and stated that the
interest could go to Ross and his mother as a gift. He warned the boys about
letting their hopes get too high, but at the same time urged them to spare no
time or pains in the search. If they were successful, they could depend on him
to reward them handsomely. As they might need a little extra money he was
enclosing fifty dollars, to be used in any way they might think best in carrying
on the hunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not such a bad old chap after all,&#8221; observed Fred, as
they finished reading the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet he isn&#8217;t!&#8221; echoed Teddy. &#8220;There are lots of
worse fellows than Uncle Aaron.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this qualified praise, they sought out their comrades, who were almost
as delighted as the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_185'></a>185</span> Rushton boys themselves were at the letter and the
money order.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to us now to get busier than ever,&#8221; remarked
Lester. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do to disappoint him after raising his
hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; replied Fred. &#8220;So get out the maps you
were talking about yesterday, and we&#8217;ll lay our plans for the next week or
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went to the room where the government maps were kept. These showed
every creek and inlet and cove and indentation of the Maine coast, together with
the depths of water at these points and a host of other details that were of use
to seafaring men.</p>

<p>The boys went at them in a businesslike way, picking out those places most
likely to be entered by a sailing ship, rejecting others that were difficult or
dangerous to approach, until they had mapped out a program that would keep them
busy for ten days to come.</p>

<p>Toward evening the storm gave signs of having spent its worst fury, and just
before supper a rift appeared in the clouds on the western horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks promising,&#8221; observed Lester to Teddy, who was looking
out over the water with him. &#8220;Probably it will clear up during the night
and we&#8217;ll have a peach of a day to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly hope so,&#8221; replied Teddy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t so
much mind being cooped up for one day, but after <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span> that it gets kind of monotonous. The
strenuous life for me, every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Lester, &#8220;one day is about my limit, too. If
it&#8217;s clear to-morrow, I&#8217;ll have to go over to Bartanet to order some
supplies and maybe you and the rest of the bunch will come along and keep me
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know,&#8221; acquiesced Teddy heartily. &#8220;We can
see all the excitement that may be stirring in that rushing burg, too. I notice
that there&#8217;s usually a great deal going on there&#8211;not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to admit that it isn&#8217;t the liveliest place
in the world,&#8221; admitted Lester with a grin. &#8220;Still, once in a while,
somebody wakes up long enough to start something. Not often, though, for a
fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were equally anxious to go and the matter was settled, provided
that the weather permitted.</p>

<p>As Lester had predicted, the next day was bright and clear and the boys were
up early. Mr. Lee had made out the list of the things he needed, and the boys
went merrily down to the little landing place where the boats were kept.</p>

<p>It was decided that they were to row over to the mainland, and Lester and
Fred took their places at the oars while the others acted as ballast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you fellows row at first,&#8221; remarked Teddy, in a
patronizing tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy going now <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span> with no storm in sight. I&#8217;ll take
it easy, but if any emergency should arise, I&#8217;ll take the oars and bring
the boat safe to shore. There&#8217;s no earthly use, though, in an expert
navigator like me spending his time in every-day tugging at a pair of oars. It
would be wasting my giant strength for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it would never do to let Ted row with an ordinary pair of
oars,&#8221; said Fred sarcastically to Lester. &#8220;He&#8217;d break those as
easily as most people would break the stem of a churchwarden pipe. Back home, we
had a pair of tempered steel oars made especially for him and even then he broke
them every once in a while. It&#8217;s really altogether too
expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should think it would be,&#8221; replied Lester gravely.
&#8220;He must be a good deal like a very strong rower we had about these parts
a few years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he have steel oars, too?&#8221; asked Ross, keeping a straight
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lester slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt he would
have used them if he could have found a pair, but as it happened there
weren&#8217;t any of that description around. He used to get around it, though,
by using two very heavy wooden oars in each hand. That was all right as far as
it went, but it wasn&#8217;t good enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what was the matter with that?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;Well, you
see, there wasn&#8217;t any boat strong enough for him,&#8221; explained Lester.
&#8220;He&#8217;d sit up in the bow and start to row, and he&#8217;d give such
tremendous strokes that the front part of the boat would tear away from the
stern and go on without it. Of course, the people who owned the boats found this
rather expensive, so after a while this man couldn&#8217;t get a steady job in
the fishing trade at all. He did get another position, though, and as far as I
know is working at it yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a job requiring some strength,&#8221; remarked Teddy.
&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carrying barrels of holes from a swiss cheese factory to be made into
crullers,&#8221; chuckled Lester. &#8220;I guess that will hold you for a while.
If you like that one, I&#8217;ll tell you some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite enough from you,&#8221; said Teddy, with great
dignity. &#8220;You&#8217;re apt to bring a judgment on us with such stuff as
that. One of these big waves may come slap into the boat and send us all to Davy
Jones&#8217; locker, if you&#8217;re not careful.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>RIDING THE SURF</span></h2>

<p>The words were spoken in jest, but they bade fair before long to turn to
earnest.</p>

<p>Although the wind had died down, the waves were still running high from the
effects of the storm. Lester, however, handled the oars like the skilled
waterman he was, and Fred was not far behind him, so that the occupants of the
boat felt that they could not be in safer hands. As they got farther out from
under the lee of the lighthouse rocks, however, they felt the force of the waves
more and more, and Lester had to draw on all his knowledge to keep the boat
headed before the big rollers. As one wave followed another, it would shoot the
boat ahead as though propelled by some invisible motor, and while this was very
exhilarating, it also had a strong element of danger. As long as they went
before the waves they were safe enough, but Lester knew that if they broached
to, broadside to the waves, they would be swamped in the twinkling of an eye.
The water was pretty shoal where they were, and while not actually surf <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> was still near enough
like it to keep them all tense and expectant.</p>

<p>As the boys approached the shore, they could see that there was a big surf
breaking on the sands. Lester scanned it closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we can get through all right, fellows,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but if we should be swamped going in, it won&#8217;t mean anything more
than a good wetting. When I say the word, Fred, we want to act fast and
together. If we can get a wave just right, we&#8217;ll shoot in like an
arrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, say when, and I&#8217;ll pull my arms out,&#8221; promised
Fred, taking a firm grip on the oars. &#8220;Let her go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out you don&#8217;t pull the boat apart,&#8221; admonished Teddy.
&#8220;Remember, I&#8217;m in the stern, and I don&#8217;t want to be left
behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>His more serious brother rebuked Teddy&#8217;s frivolity with a glance, and
then turned his eyes toward the line of thundering surf they were rapidly
approaching. Lester was absorbed in the problem before him, glancing now at the
line of breakers and then at the big waves chasing the boat, each one looking as
though it must surely overwhelm it. At last, when they were not more than a
hundred feet from the beach, Lester bent to the oars with all his strength,
calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Fred, pull! Pull for all you&#8217;re worth!&#8221;</p>

<p>An involuntary exclamation broke from Bill as <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span> he glanced astern. Close behind was a
gigantic roller, its foaming crest already starting to bend over. As he gazed,
fascinated, the crest broke and rushed at the little boat with a seething hiss.
Up, up went the stern and the bow dug deep into the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull, pull!&#8221; yelled Lester.</p>

<p>His oars and Fred&#8217;s bent beneath the force of their straining backs.
For a moment it seemed as though the wave must surely break into the boat and
swamp it. But suddenly they felt the boat leap forward, as though some giant of
the deep had seized it and thrown it from him. With the white water boiling
under the stern the boat raced on, caught in the grip of the breaker and
traveling inshore with the same speed at which the wave itself moved. The bow
cut through the water, curling up a bow wave on each side that at times came
into the boat.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little craft started to turn to starboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull on the starboard side,&#8221; shouted Lester, suiting the action
to the word.</p>

<p>Fred promptly obeyed, and after a few straining strokes, the boat returned to
a straight path before the roller and the next moment had rushed up on the sand,
propelled by the last force of the breaker which went seething and hissing up
the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out! Get out! Quick!&#8221; shouted Fred. &#8220;Let&#8217;s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span> lift the boat up higher
before the next wave comes. Lively&#8217;s the word!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys leaped out and rapidly dragged the boat up past the high water mark,
just as another wave, even larger than the one that had carried them in, came
sweeping over the place where they had landed.</p>

<p>They were a little white and shaken at the danger they had passed through,
but at the same time were wildly exhilarated by the excitement of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy. &#8220;It seemed to me that we were
traveling faster than the Twentieth Century Limited just then. Why, we were
fairly flying. While we were going through I was scared to death, but now I
think I&#8217;d like to go out and try it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while I&#8217;m still in my right mind,&#8221; protested Lester.
&#8220;Surf riding is good sport sometimes, but not when there&#8217;s the kind
of sea running that there is to-day. It&#8217;s possible to have too much of a
good thing, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose so,&#8221; said the incorrigible Teddy. &#8220;But you
fellows didn&#8217;t have anything to worry about, anyway. I was in the stern,
and if a wave had come aboard, I&#8217;d have been the one to get wet
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by about one-tenth of a second,&#8221; laughed Bill.
&#8220;However, all&#8217;s well that ends well. I think we all owe a vote of
thanks to Teddy for taking us <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_193'></a>193</span> through the way he did. Nobody could have sat there
and watched others work better than Teddy did. I think he deserves all sorts of
credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, I was neutral,&#8221; explained Teddy. &#8220;If I
didn&#8217;t help you, you&#8217;ll have to admit that I didn&#8217;t help the
wave, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ted wins,&#8221; declared Lester. &#8220;Anybody who wants to prove
anything against him has got to get up early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s ever accused of a crime, he&#8217;ll be able to argue
his way out without half trying,&#8221; affirmed Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;He could probably get off by giving the judge and jury a bad attack of
brain fever,&#8221; sniffed Fred. &#8220;But what do you say; shall we bail the
boat out? We shipped quite a good deal of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so much, considering what we came through,&#8221; replied Lester.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s turn the boat over and save the trouble of
bailing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned it over on one side and soon had all the water drained out. Then
they left it to dry out in the sun until they should be ready to return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a wiggle on now,&#8221; enjoined Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a
lot to do and we&#8217;d better get going at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys started off at a brisk pace and soon found themselves in the part of
the village where the stores were located. They made the rounds, Lester making
the purchases and having them <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_194'></a>194</span> wrapped up for him and his friends to call for and
carry back later on. They met several of Lester&#8217;s friends and the time
passed so quickly that they were surprised when they found that it was past
noon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time to eat!&#8221; exclaimed Teddy. &#8220;Think of me passing up
lunch time like that! I must be sick or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather a bad sign,&#8221; admitted his brother. &#8220;Still I
guess you&#8217;re not going to die just yet. Only the good die young, and that
lets you out. But what do you say to stopping in somewhere and getting a bite,
Lester? Now that it&#8217;s brought to my attention, I find that I&#8217;m
almost as hungry as Ted usually is. And I can&#8217;t put it much stronger than
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Lester, &#8220;I was thinking that it might be
fun to buy something here and eat it on the way back. We can get some sandwiches
and other things and have a regular picnic after we get out of town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; pronounced Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the sooner the better,&#8221; added Ross.</p>

<p>The lads stopped at the nearest store that promised to supply their needs. As
they gazed in the window, trying to make up their minds what to buy, Teddy
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a nuisance it is to choose! You always have to leave behind more
than you take away. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_195'></a>195</span> If I had plenty of money, I&#8217;d buy out the
whole store. Wait till we unearth that fortune of Ross&#8217; and
then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h, keep quiet,&#8221; warned Fred in a low tone. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want to tell the whole town all you know, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a slip of the tongue for fair,&#8221; confessed Teddy
ruefully, &#8220;but I won&#8217;t do it again, honest. Besides, nobody could
have heard me.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANDY SHANKS, EAVESDROPPER</span></h2>

<p>Suddenly the boys heard two voices raised in what seemed to be an altercation
of some kind. The sound appeared to come from behind a board fence a few feet
away.</p>

<p>One of the speakers was evidently threatening, while the other was begging
off from something that had been demanded of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; the latter was saying.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve already given you every cent of my allowance and I&#8217;ve
borrowed from every friend I have in this town. You can&#8217;t get blood out of
a stone. If gold dollars were selling for fifty cents, I couldn&#8217;t buy
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, you must,&#8221; the other said fiercely. &#8220;I know
well enough you can pawn something. You can get a few plunks on that ring and
scarf-pin of yours. I&#8217;ve long ago put everything I had in hock. Come now,
Sid,&#8221; and the voice became more wheedling in tone, &#8220;you know well
enough this state of things won&#8217;t last long. The old man will take me back
again and I&#8217;ll be rolling in money. Then I can pay back all you&#8217;ve
let me have.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>Fred and Teddy
looked at each other with a conviction that flashed on both of them at the same
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have I heard those dulcet tones before?&#8221; murmured Fred.
&#8220;Either I&#8217;m going crazy or that&#8217;s Andy Shanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other is Sid Wilton,&#8221; replied Teddy. &#8220;Come to
think of it, I heard he lived down this way somewhere. I wonder what all this
gab is about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that Andy&#8217;s father has thrown him out to face
life on his own hook,&#8221; conjectured Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he doesn&#8217;t seem to be making a success of it,&#8221; judged
Bill.</p>

<p>Just then the two debaters emerged from behind the fence and came face to
face with their former schoolmates.</p>

<p>The former bully of Rally Hall and his crony started back, and for a moment
were so nonplussed that they could do nothing but stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Sid?&#8221; said Fred, breaking a silence that was
beginning to be awkward.</p>

<p>Sid made a stammering reply.</p>

<p>Andy had flushed angrily at the sight of the boys and seemed about to indulge
in his usual bluster, but a thought appeared to come to him suddenly that made
him change his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, fellows?&#8221; he asked, in a way that <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span> was meant to be
ingratiating, and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>The movement was so wholly unexpected that for an instant the boys hardly
knew what to do. They all disliked him heartily, and the Rushton boys in
particular had been bitterly wronged by him during their first year at Rally
Hall. Still, it would have seemed ungracious to reject the proffered hand, so
they took it under protest, mentally resolved to get away from him as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>It was a different Andy from the one to whom they had been accustomed. He had
formerly been expensively dressed, and had borne himself with the arrogance of
the snob and the brutality of the bully. Now he was beginning to look shabby and
his eyes had a furtive look very different from the insolent assurance that the
boys remembered.</p>

<p>They exchanged a few commonplace remarks, and then, as Andy made no move
toward following Sid, who had excused himself and gone on, Bill finally gave him
a gentle hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so long, Andy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to be
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the motive for Andy&#8217;s sudden change of front became apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait just a minute,&#8221; he said rather sheepishly. &#8220;Will you
fellows do me a favor and lend me a five spot? I&#8217;m stony broke&#8211;not a
dime to bless myself with. You know the governor has gone <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span> back on me. Says he won&#8217;t give me
a red cent, and that I&#8217;ll have to learn to hoe my own row. I&#8217;m up
against it for fair, and I know you fellows won&#8217;t mind lending me a little
something. I&#8217;ll pay it back as soon as the old man comes across, which
he&#8217;s bound to do sooner or later. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fred, who remembered how the bully had tried to put on him the theft of some
examination papers at Rally Hall, hesitated, but Teddy, who noticed how shabby
and downcast Andy looked, intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we might fix it up,&#8221; he ventured to say. &#8220;Just let
me speak to the others for a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had a short conference, as a result of which Teddy collected and handed
over the five dollars that Andy desired.</p>

<p>Andy&#8217;s thanks were profuse, but after having tucked the money safely
away in his pocket, something of his old surly manner returned. He took leave of
his benefactors with scant ceremony, but the boys were so glad to get rid of him
that they hardly noticed this.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; remarked Bill, as they watched Andy go down the
street, &#8220;five dollars isn&#8217;t so much to pay for getting free from
that bird. I&#8217;d be willing to lose a lot more than that if I could be sure
of never seeing him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys made their purchases and took their way to the place that Lester had
in mind to eat <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
their lunch. They found themselves on a high sand dune, overgrown with coarse
grass. It afforded an excellent view of the sea and also furnished a comfortable
place to lean against.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is great!&#8221; exclaimed Ross. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out that
grub and pitch in. I could eat a barrel full of brass tacks and never know I had
eaten anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you wouldn&#8217;t know anything very long,&#8221; laughed
Lester, as he proceeded to lay out the provisions.</p>

<p>The eatables vanished with surprising speed, and after the first sharp edge
of their hunger had worn off, the conversation turned, as it usually did these
days, to their quest for the missing treasure.</p>

<p>A brisk breeze was blowing in from the ocean and the brittle sand grass kept
up a constant rustling. This sound served admirably to cover the approach of a
stealthy figure that had followed the boys at a distance ever since they had
left Bartanet. This figure crept closer and closer to the sand dune, until only
a projecting hump concealed it from the five boys on the seaward side.</p>

<p>As it attained this position of vantage, Teddy was addressing a remark to
Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you lost a bit of your confidence yet, Ross?&#8221; he
queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a particle,&#8221; affirmed Ross stoutly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll find
that treasure, sooner or later, if it ever was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_201'></a>201</span> actually hidden in the neighborhood of Bartanet
Shoals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet we will!&#8221; declared Fred, &#8220;even if we have to
import a steam shovel to dig up the whole territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will be soon,&#8221; interposed Bill. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
us for Rally Hall, you know, before long, and then what chance will we
have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a stiff upper lip,&#8221; counseled Lester. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
just begun to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the conversation the eavesdropper had lain quietly and listened with
the closest attention. Now he edged away cautiously, and when he had reached a
sufficient distance rose to his feet and hurried back in the direction of
Bartanet.</p>

<p>The boys light-heartedly got into their boat and rowed back to the lighthouse
without the slightest suspicion that almost all they had said had been overheard
by Andy Shanks.</p>

<p>That rascal hastened back to town, his brain awhirl with dreams of sudden
riches. He had heard enough to know that there was treasure buried in or around
Bartanet, and he also knew that the boys whom he held in hatred were in search
of it. What joy to steal the riches from them and thus gain the twofold
advantage of thwarting them and at the same time putting himself in a position
to indulge those vices in which he delighted!</p>

<p>Before Andy had gone far, he met one of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_202'></a>202</span> village youths whose acquaintance he had recently
made. Unfortunately for Andy, this young fellow, who was named Morton, had a
strong liking for practical jokes, and after Andy, with his usual boastfulness,
had thrown out sly hints about knowing how to &#8220;pick up all the money that
he wanted,&#8221; Morton scented a chance to make a victim.</p>

<p>As Andy was very vague regarding the sources from which he expected to get
his wealth, Morton did not hesitate to impart to Andy the slighting opinion that
he was &#8220;talking through his hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much I&#8217;m not,&#8221; retorted Andy, stung by the imputation.
&#8220;I tell you I know there&#8217;s oodles of money buried somewhere around
here and what&#8217;s more, if you&#8217;ll help me to find it, I&#8217;ll let
you in for a share of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His acquaintance, seeing that Andy was in earnest, quickly formed a plan to
have some fun at the other&#8217;s expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, seeing you&#8217;re so certain of it, I <i>will</i> help you,
then!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Shake hands on the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>BADLY FOOLED</span></h2>

<p>Morton gravely extended his hand and Andy shook it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, now,&#8221; said the town youth, pretending to be
racking his memory, &#8220;whereabouts could that money be hid? It&#8217;s
probably in some old shack or cave somewhere. Say!&#8221; he shouted as though
struck by an idea, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wager I know the identical place where
it&#8217;s stowed away. Come to think of it, I&#8217;m sure I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where? Where?&#8221; questioned Andy eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know you&#8217;re on the square and won&#8217;t give me the
double cross,&#8221; replied Morton, &#8220;so I don&#8217;t mind telling you
what I know.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was an old fellow partly tipsy one winter night, who told me a
long yarn about knowing where there was a mint of money hidden away. I
didn&#8217;t pay any attention to him then, because I thought he was just
raving, the way those people often do. But now I come to think of it, I remember
his speaking of an old hut that was almost buried in a sand dune close to the
water. Let&#8217;s see <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> now, where is there an old shack that answers to
that description?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton pretended to meditate deeply, while Andy waited breathlessly for him
to continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; exclaimed Morton abruptly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
place old Totten used to have on the beach just north of Bartanet. He kept very
close to himself, but he always seemed to have slathers of money. He died two or
three years ago, and since then the sand has nearly rolled over his shack.
I&#8217;ll venture to say that if we dug there we&#8217;d find money enough to
make us both rich for the rest of our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By jinks! but I believe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; blurted out Andy
with an avaricious glitter in his shifty eyes. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go there
to-night and see if we can find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we won&#8217;t be able to go to-night,&#8221; protested Morton.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get picks and shovels, and we&#8217;ll have to do it
so quietly that nobody will catch on. And I can&#8217;t do it to-morrow night,
either,&#8221; he continued, as though just recalling something.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an engagement that I can&#8217;t break. But I&#8217;ll
make it the night after that, if you&#8217;re willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; assented Andy. &#8220;That suits me fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was a reluctance to look into Morton&#8217;s eyes as Andy spoke,
that convinced the joker that his plans would work out as he expected. He <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span> knew Andy Shanks pretty
well, and he was sure that Andy would not wait till the appointed time to hunt
for the treasure. He guessed that Andy would endeavor to cheat him out of his
share of the fictitious treasure by getting in before the time agreed upon. And
he made no mistake in reckoning on the mean nature of Andy Shanks.</p>

<p>The two arranged the details of the expedition, such as securing shovels and
picks and candles. Then they parted, after Morton had exacted an oath of secrecy
from the other.</p>

<p>The latter was no sooner left to himself, however, than he began revolving in
his mind plans to outwit the friend, who, he thought, had confided in him so
completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky thing for me,&#8221; thought Andy, &#8220;that he
can&#8217;t be there to-morrow night. I&#8217;ll get a pick and shovel somewhere
and beat him to it. If he&#8217;s such a fool as to tell all he knows, he
deserves to lose his share.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Morton was hugging himself in anticipation. He confided the
matter to a few of his friends, who were delighted at the chance of playing a
joke on Shanks, who was anything but popular in the town. All volunteered to
help Morton, and having secured an old trunk, they armed themselves with spades
and sallied forth in the direction of Totten&#8217;s old shack.</p>

<p>After shoveling the sand away from before the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> door, they entered and started to
&#8220;plant the treasure,&#8221; as one of them expressed it. They dug a hole
four feet deep and wide enough to contain the trunk. Then they filled the trunk
with sand and lowered it into the excavation. This done, they filled the hole up
again, replaced the rotting boards that formed the floor and surveyed the
completed job with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that will keep him busy for a while,&#8221; remarked Morton,
&#8220;especially as he won&#8217;t know where to look and will have to dig the
whole place up, more or less. It&#8217;s going to be more fun than a
circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we want to see him while he&#8217;s at it,&#8221; objected one of
his followers. &#8220;How are we going to manage it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Morton. &#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll have
to clear the sand away from the little window there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads set to work with a will and soon had enough of the sand shoveled
away to permit a clear view of the interior of the shack. This accomplished,
they closed the door and heaped sand against it, leaving everything as they had
found it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; declared Morton, &#8220;that was considerable work, but
it will be worth it. We&#8217;ll hustle back to town now and tell the other
fellows that everything&#8217;s all right. Then we&#8217;ll have nothing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span> do but wait for
the fun. I&#8217;m as sure as I am that I&#8217;m alive that that sneak will try
to circumvent me. I could see it in his eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andy spent a restless night, his mind busied with plans to get the best of
Morton. He rose early the next morning and roamed restlessly about town. The
great problem confronting him was how to get the pick and shovel without
Morton&#8217;s getting wind of it. He finally concluded that it would be taking
too much of a risk to buy the implements in the village, so he made a trip to a
town five miles distant and got the necessary tools.</p>

<p>Night came at last, and the sneak sallied forth and set out for the old
cabin, the location of which Morton had been careful to give to him. Throwing
down his tools, Andy carefully reconnoitred the surroundings. The jokers had
done their work so carefully that he saw nothing amiss, and after satisfying
himself that the coast was clear, he started digging in the sand in front of the
door.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to gain an entrance, and after getting in he lit two
of his candles and took a careful survey of the surroundings. There was nothing
in sight to give him a clue. The sole furniture consisted of an old table and a
couple of rickety chairs.</p>

<p>Somewhat at a loss where to begin, Andy finally started sounding the rough
planking of the floor. When he came to the place where the planks had <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span> been ripped up the
preceding evening, he saw that they were loose and resolved to take a chance
there. He removed the boards, took off his coat and began to dig in earnest.</p>

<p>He made rapid progress at first, but soon his muscles, flabby and unused to
such strenuous exercise, began to protest and he was forced to take a breathing
spell.</p>

<p>Had he chanced to glance at the little window, his labors might have come to
a premature conclusion. Grouped outside were Morton and his friends, almost
bursting with smothered laughter. The sight of Andy, whose antipathy to work was
well known, sweating away over the hardest kind of labor, amused them
immensely.</p>

<p>Wholly unconscious of the amusement he was providing, Andy resumed his task
and worked with such good will that it was not long before his spade struck on
the edge of the buried trunk. He uttered a shout of delight and scattered the
remaining sand in every direction. Before long he had uncovered the top of the
trunk. This he tried to lift out of the hole. Finding it too heavy for this,
however, and not able to restrain his impatience to see what it contained, he
seized the pickax and smashed in the top.</p>

<p>His chagrin may be imagined when instead of the treasure he expected he found
that the trunk was filled with sand. On top of this was a sheet <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span> of paper which Morton
had placed there the previous evening. It contained one word done in heavy
capitals:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>STUNG!</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>For a few moments Andy gazed stupidly, unable for the time to understand that
he had been made the victim of a hoax. While this was slowly dawning upon him,
the door burst open and, with a yell of laughter, the crowd rushed into the
hut.</p>

<p>Andy jumped as though he had been shot, and, scrambling out of the hole,
stood with open mouth facing the laughing boys. His surprised and discomfited
attitude was so ludicrous that their laughter increased tenfold and they fairly
shrieked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh-what&#8217;s the big idea, anyway?&#8221; gasped Andy at last.
&#8220;How did you fellows come to be here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; replied Morton, sobering down a little, &#8220;I
counted on your doing the crooked thing and I wasn&#8217;t mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get even with you some day,&#8221; growled Andy. &#8220;You
think you&#8217;re pretty smart, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you ask me, I must admit I cherish some such idea,&#8221;
admitted Morton, his eyes twinkling. &#8220;The fellows from the city
don&#8217;t always know everything, you understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll live to be sorry for this trick,&#8221; blustered Andy.
&#8220;You just see if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>He made his way
to the door and passed out amid another burst of merriment from those who had
witnessed his discomfiture, leaving his implements lying where he had thrown
them.</p>

<p>An account of the affair spread quickly over the village and life for Andy
became so unbearable that before another twenty-four hours he left the town.</p>

<p>In the natural course of events the story came to the ears of the boys at the
lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have given something to be there,&#8221; declared Bill.
&#8220;It must have been worth a year&#8217;s allowance to see his face when all
those fellows gave him the laugh. He thinks such a lot of himself that it must
have been a bitter pill to swallow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let alone his not finding what he went after,&#8221; put in Fred.
&#8220;It hit him in his pride and his pocketbook, and they&#8217;re both
sensitive spots with Andy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you suppose he got wind of our being in search of
treasure?&#8221; queried Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering at that,&#8221; replied Lester, &#8220;and the only
way I could figure it out is that he must have followed us the day we were at
Bartanet, and heard what we were talking about when we were eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; concluded Fred, &#8220;he couldn&#8217;t have got
anything of real value from what we said, or he wouldn&#8217;t have gone digging
in old Totten&#8217;s shack. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span> But it&#8217;s up to us to put a padlock on our
lips when there&#8217;s any chance of being overheard. We may not be so lucky
the next time.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A FIGHTING CHANCE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Only one week more now before we have to go back to Rally Hall,&#8221;
sighed Teddy one morning, just after they had risen from the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;And nothing done yet in the way of finding that chest of gold,&#8221;
groaned Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now or never,&#8221; declared Lester with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s never, then,&#8221; put in Bill, the
skeptical. &#8220;Here for days we&#8217;ve been blistering our hands and
breaking our backs, to say nothing of racking what brains we have, and
we&#8217;re no nearer finding it than we were at the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say that,&#8221; protested Fred.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve at least explored a lot of places where there were no signs
of the peculiar trees and rock shown in that map that Ross told us about. That
leaves just so many fewer places to waste our time on, and makes it more likely
that the next will be the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much nourishment in that,&#8221; persisted Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
admit that we&#8217;ve found plenty of places where the gold <i>isn&#8217;t</i>,
but that doesn&#8217;t get us anywhere. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_213'></a>213</span> And we&#8217;ll be gray-headed before we can
explore the whole coast of Maine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop your grouching, you old sinner,&#8221; exhorted Teddy,
clapping him on the back. &#8220;This is like football or baseball. The game
isn&#8217;t over till after the last minute of play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221; cried Lester emphatically. &#8220;If we
go down, we&#8217;ll do it with the guns shotted and the band playing and the
flag flying.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that the lads were all assailed at times by the
doubt and discouragement that troubled Bill acutely that morning. They had taken
advantage of every day when the sea permitted, and, as Teddy phrased it, had
&#8220;raked the coast fore and aft.&#8221; Their main reliance had been the map
that had appeared in the story of the old sailor to Ross, and the first thing
they did after entering any bay or cove was to look about them for the clump of
two and three trees, with the big rock standing at the right. Once or twice they
had found conditions that nearly answered this description, and they had dug and
hunted near by, wherever the lay of the land held out any hope of success.</p>

<p>In the absence of anything better, this supposed map was their strongest
clue. Yet even this was only supposition. It might not have been anything more
than the fanciful sketch of an idle sailor. Or if it indeed were a map of any
given locality, it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
might not refer in the slightest degree to the robbery by the crew of the
smuggler.</p>

<p>The knowledge that this might be so had at times a paralyzing effect on the
boys. They felt the lack of solid ground beneath their feet. Like the coffin of
Mahomet, they were as though suspended between earth and sky.</p>

<p>Still, it was the only clue they had, and there was something in the make-up
of these sturdy young Americans that made them desperately unwilling to confess
defeat. It was the &#8220;die-in-the-last-ditch&#8221; spirit that has made
America great. Even Bill, although he relieved himself sometimes by grumbling,
would not really have given up the search and when the pinch came he dug and
hunted as eagerly as the rest.</p>

<p>This morning, they had arranged to set off for a final cruise that might take
up all the remaining time of their vacation, which was now drawing rapidly to a
close. Their party was complete, with the exception of Ross. He had gone up to
Oakland to spend a few days with his mother, who had arrived from Canada, but he
had arranged to meet the boys that day at a point agreed on, about fifteen miles
up the coast.</p>

<p>As their cruise was expected to be longer than usual, it took them some time
before they had everything on board the <i>Ariel</i> and were ready to cast off
from the little pier below the lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_215'></a>215</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Lee, who had come down
to see them off, &#8220;good-by, boys, and luck go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch us come back with that chest of gold,&#8221; called out Teddy
gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be watching, all right,&#8221; grinned the lighthouse
keeper, &#8220;and I have a sort of hunch that you boys will get there this
time. You certainly have earned it, if you do lay your hands on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s no merry jest, either,&#8221; remarked Bill, as he
looked at the callous spots on his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill wasn&#8217;t made to work,&#8221; scoffed Teddy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s made to sit on the box and crack the whip, while we common
trash pull and strain in the shafts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; retorted Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;m no mule
driver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a touching picture, that of Teddy pulling and straining,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; laughed Lester, as he pointed to that young gentleman
slumped down comfortably in the stern.</p>

<p>With jest and banter, the morning wore away. The day was serene and
beautiful, with not a cloud obscuring the sky, while there was just enough wind
to make their progress steady and rapid. Almost before they knew it, they had
reached the point agreed upon with Ross, and soon after descried the
<i>Sleuth</i> coming down to meet them.</p>

<p>They hailed Ross cordially, and his beaming face showed how deep and warm was
his feeling for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
the boys, whom he already seemed to have known for years rather than weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some smart navigators, we are, to meet just where we arranged
to!&#8221; laughed Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the real thing in the way of sailor men,&#8221; assented
Ross, throwing out his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the mutual admiration society,&#8221; jibed the
irrepressible Teddy. &#8220;Blushing violets aren&#8217;t in it with them. Here
you let my modest worth pass unnoticed, while you&#8217;re handing bouquets to
each other. But that&#8217;s the way it is in this world. It&#8217;s nerve and
gall that counts. Now if I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>But his eloquent peroration was spoiled by a hasty shift to escape a life
preserver that Lester hurled at his head, missing him by an inch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better let me have Teddy aboard the <i>Sleuth</i>,&#8221;
laughed Ross. &#8220;Then if the engine gives out, I&#8217;ll start Teddy
wagging his tongue. That will furnish power enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; replied Lester. &#8220;I want him here, in
case the wind gives out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s evident that I&#8217;m the most important person here,
anyway,&#8221; retorted Teddy. &#8220;Neither one of you seems to be willing to
get along without me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven cities claimed Homer, you know,&#8221; said Bill
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Teddy complacently, &#8220;he and I are in the same
class.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>Ross turned his
boat around, and the two craft went along side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sea&#8217;s like a mill pond to-day,&#8221; remarked Fred.
&#8220;How different from the day of the storm, when we watched it from the
observation room. Do you remember what your father said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not especially,&#8221; answered Lester. &#8220;What particular thing
do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, when he prophesied that many a good ship would lay her bones on a
reef or beach before the storm was over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he was anxious,&#8221; answered Lester gravely, &#8220;but I
haven&#8217;t heard of any ship&#8217;s being wrecked on this particular strip
of the coast during this storm. The worst time we&#8217;ve had around here, as
far as I can remember, was about three years ago. That storm kept up for three
days and three nights, and when it was over there were at least a dozen wrecks,
just on the coast of Maine.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he went on, as a sudden thought struck him,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll have to pass one of those wrecks a few miles from here.
It&#8217;s a schooner that went ashore in the storm. There&#8217;s part of the
hull left, and, if you like, we&#8217;ll run in and look it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was the crew saved?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every soul aboard was drowned,&#8221; Lester answered soberly.
&#8220;They were swept overboard before the life-saving crew could get to them.
The masts went over the side, and the hull was driven <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span> so hard and deep into the sand that it
has been there ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half hour more passed, and then Lester gave a twist to the tiller and
turned the <i>Ariel</i> inshore.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the wreck,&#8221; he said in response to Fred&#8217;s
look of inquiry, as he pointed to a dark object near the beach.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll just run in and look her over. But we won&#8217;t be able to
stay more than a few minutes, for this is to be one of our busy days.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ABANDONED SCHOONER</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; cried Teddy suddenly, pointing at right angles to the
course they were pursuing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; came from his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shark,&#8221; cried Teddy excitedly. &#8220;Perhaps
it&#8217;s the mate of the one we caught the other day. Have you your harpoon
along, Lester?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Lester, as he, with the others, watched the ominous
black fin just showing above the surface; &#8220;and I haven&#8217;t the shark
hook, either. It&#8217;s just as well anyway, because we can&#8217;t afford the
time to-day to look after that fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; sighed Teddy, reluctantly
abandoning his idea, &#8220;but I sure would like to add to my collection of
shark&#8217;s teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we find the chest, and you&#8217;ll have money enough to buy
a shark and keep him as a pet,&#8221; suggested Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;And feed him out of your hand,&#8221; grinned Ross.</p>

<p>As they drew near the shore, the wreck of the abandoned schooner came clearly
into view. It was a dismal spectacle. There was nothing visible above the main
deck, not even stumps. The masts <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_220'></a>220</span> had been snapped close to their butts, showing the
terrific fury of the gale that had severed them almost as neatly as though done
by a razor. There were several yawning rents in the side through which the water
poured and retreated. It was evident that the hold must be entirely flooded. The
bow was deeply imbedded in the sand, and there was only a slight perceptible
motion of the stern, as it swayed and lifted in obedience to the surge of the
waves.</p>

<p>The ship seemed at a casual glance to be about eighty feet in length. The
beam was comparatively narrow, and the long graceful lines falling away from the
bow showed that she had been built for speed. She was of the greyhound type, and
this fact only emphasized her present forlorn condition.</p>

<p>Despite the dilapidated condition of the lower part of the hull, the upper
part and the deck itself seemed to be fairly solid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good timber in that old boat,&#8221; muttered Lester, as they came
close, &#8220;or she&#8217;d have broken up into kindling wood long
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to get aboard?&#8221; asked Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;By way of the stern, I guess,&#8221; Lester replied, as he measured
distances. &#8220;Of course it would be easier to get over the bow, but
we&#8217;d have to go pretty close inshore for that, and I don&#8217;t know just
how deep it is there. I don&#8217;t want to take any chances with the
<i>Ariel</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>Fred shortened
sail, and they ran in cautiously under the stern. The planks were weatherbeaten,
but there were still some vestiges of paint on the upper part, and the boys
could clearly make out the name of the unfortunate boat to have been the
<i>Albatross</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old <i>Albatross</i>,&#8221; murmured Fred. &#8220;Her wings are
broken, sure enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll never fly again,&#8221; added Bill.</p>

<p>They put the fenders over the side to avoid scraping, and Lester tossed a
coil of rope over a butt that rose at the end of the stern. He held the ends,
while Teddy shinned up like a monkey and fastened it more securely. Then Fred
and Bill went up, while Lester stayed below to look after the safety of his
craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you fellows coming along?&#8221; asked Fred, looking down
over the stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; replied Lester. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen lots of
wrecks in my time, and I want to make sure that the <i>Ariel</i> doesn&#8217;t
make another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Ross?&#8221; inquired Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay and keep Lester company,&#8221; Ross answered, as he
brought the <i>Sleuth</i> a little closer. &#8220;You can tell us what you see,
which can&#8217;t be much, I suppose, after all this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little more friendly urging, the others acquiesced in the arrangement
and went forward, cautiously testing each plank before they set their <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> feet down, for fear it
might give way under them.</p>

<p>A certain feeling of eeriness settled down upon them. Living men, hearty,
boisterous, vigorous men, full of the joy of life, had trodden these planks when
the vessel was in her prime and winging her way over the seas as swiftly as the
gull whose name she bore. Now the hungry waves had swallowed them, and the
subdued chanting of the water along her side might well be their requiem.</p>

<p>Instinctively the boys drew closer together, and their voices lowered almost
to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Makes you feel kind of creepy, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure does,&#8221; answered Teddy. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care to
sleep here over night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t do much sleeping,&#8221; affirmed Fred.
&#8220;You&#8217;d be expecting every minute to see something standing at the
foot of your bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But these first fancies could not long endure in the flood of sunlight that
beat upon the schooner, and the boys soon recovered their normal confidence.
They went through the captain&#8217;s cabin and two others that had evidently
been set apart for the mates. Except one or two sodden mattresses and a huddled
bunch of mouldy bed coverings, there was nothing of the slightest value.
Whatever there had been at the time of the wreck had either been washed
overboard or taken possession <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_223'></a>223</span> of by the authorities, shortly after the wreck
occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more to see here,&#8221; declared Bill, after a brief look
around. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better join the other fellows now.
Lester&#8217;ll be anxious to get going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o,&#8221; acceded Fred. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a move
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>But something, he did not know what, moved Teddy to stay a little longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows go back and unfasten the rope,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll be with you in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went slowly back to the stern and started to untie the rope, bantering
meanwhile with Lester and Ross, who were getting restive.</p>

<p>Teddy ran forward toward the bow and looked into the gloomy depths of the
forecastle. He could see that the floor was solid, but it was some inches deep
in water. He hesitated only a moment and then leaped lightly down.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, Fred and Bill were startled to see Teddy running toward
them, his face as white as chalk and his eyes blazing with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; they cried in alarm, leaping to their
feet.</p>

<p>Teddy tried to speak, but for a moment no words came.</p>

<p>&#8220;The m-m-map!&#8221; he stuttered at last. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the
f-forecastle!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>&#8220;The
map?&#8221; repeated Bill blankly.</p>

<p>A light sprang into Fred&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the map that the sailor carved?&#8221; he demanded,
clutching his brother&#8217;s arm with a force like a vise.</p>

<p>Teddy nodded, still a prey to his tremendous agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can it be?&#8221; asked Fred wildly. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
the <i>Ranger</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it isn&#8217;t?&#8221; cried Bill, catching the
contagion. &#8220;Her name was changed, you remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you fellows chinning about up there?&#8221; demanded Lester,
with a touch of impatience in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester!&#8221; called Fred. &#8220;Scrape the paint off the name on
the stern there, and see if you can make out anything underneath.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lester took out his claspknife and scraped vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been something else there,&#8221; he announced after a
moment, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t fully make it out. I can see a couple of
R&#8217;s&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; shouted Fred jubilantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
old <i>Ranger</i>. Come aboard, you fellows. Lively, now. Don&#8217;t mind about
the boats. They&#8217;re safe enough for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment more, and those on board were joined by Ross and Lester, as
breathless and excited as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_225'></a>225</span> themselves, for the meaning of Teddy&#8217;s
discovery had dawned upon them.</p>

<p>They all raced to the forecastle and tumbled in pell mell.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>TREASURE COVE</span></h2>

<p>With a finger that he vainly tried to keep steady, Teddy pointed to a rough
tracing on the wall at the left side of the forecastle.</p>

<p>It took a moment to accustom their eyes to the dim light of the place, then
their vision cleared and the boys could make out the details of a map similar to
the one which the old sailor had described to Ross.</p>

<p>There were two clumps, one consisting of two and the other of three trees, at
a little distance in from the beach. To the right was a huge rock that rose like
some giant sentinel and seemed to mark the entrance to a bay or cove. A series
of waving lines appeared to indicate the water, and a more heavily shaded part
was evidently meant to denote the land. There was no artistic element in the
drawing, but just then the boys would not have exchanged the rough scrawl of
that knife blade for a painting by Titian or Raphael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory, hallelujah!&#8221; shouted Teddy, who had by this time
recovered his power of speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eureka!&#8221; cried Lester.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found it,&#8221; translated
Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joy!&#8221; exulted Bill, his habitual caution swept away in the flood
of his excitement.</p>

<p>Ross alone said nothing, though his trembling hands and moistened eyes
betrayed the depth of his emotion. To the Rally Hall boys this meant a
tremendous step forward, they hoped, toward the achievement of their ambition.
It meant all that, too, to Ross, but it meant much more. He was on the spot
where his father had been foully assaulted and brought to his death. Somewhere
in this ship there had been the scuffling of feet and the thud of a deadly
weapon, as his father had fought for his property and his life.</p>

<p>The other boys were quick to recognize his feeling, and with the true
courtesy that marked them, they strove to restrain their exultation for a time,
and to talk among themselves until Ross should have had time to get a grip on
himself.</p>

<p>Bill, as usual, was the first to put a brake on their optimism and subdue
their enthusiasm by questioning cautiously the real value of their
discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s splendid, of course,&#8221; he ventured to suggest,
&#8220;but, after all, what does it give us that we didn&#8217;t already know?
To be sure, it shows that the sailor was telling the truth. But there
doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything in the map that he hadn&#8217;t already
described.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_228'></a>228</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; admitted Teddy, his
enthusiasm a little dampened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure that there&#8217;s nothing else,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;It&#8217;s so dark in here that we can&#8217;t see anything but the
rough outlines. Who has some matches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; replied Lester, producing an oilskin pouch from
an inside pocket.</p>

<p>Fred struck one, and as it flared up, five eager pairs of eyes scanned the
wall in front.</p>

<p>But while it brought into greater distinctness the main features that they
had already seen, the map seemed to reveal nothing more and there was a general
sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t that fellow go a little further while he was about
it?&#8221; groaned Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had only told us not only what it looked like, but where it
was,&#8221; mourned Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s maddening to get so close and yet miss the one thing that
would clear it all up,&#8221; complained Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand now how Tom Bixby felt, when Dick was just on the
point of telling him where the gold was hidden,&#8221; said Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not giving it up yet,&#8221; declared Fred with
determination, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll not, until I have used up every match we
have with us. Even after that, I&#8217;ll get a torch somewhere and keep on
looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>But several more matches struck in quick succession <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span> were of no more value than the first,
and the boys&#8217; hearts went down.</p>

<p>Just as the fifth match was burning low, Bill gave utterance to a sharp
exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw something down in the corner that time,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;It looked like figures of some kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had a deep belief in Bill&#8217;s sharp eyes, and it was with
renewed hope that Fred struck another of the precious matches and held it with
fingers that trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was right!&#8221; exulted Bill. &#8220;See there,&#8221; and he
pointed to some scarcely legible marks in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re figures, all right,&#8221; he confirmed. &#8220;I can
make out a &#8216;four&#8217; and a &#8216;seven&#8217; and, yes, a &#8216;six.&#8217; But
they&#8217;re very faint and I can&#8217;t make sense of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try again, Bill,&#8221; begged Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; cried Ross. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a small
magnifying glass in the cabin of the <i>Sleuth</i>. I&#8217;ll get it in a
second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; gloated Fred. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll
make it out, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was less than two minutes, but it seemed a long time to the
impatient boys before Ross dropped into the forecastle, holding a small but
powerful convex glass.</p>

<p>Bill snatched it eagerly and held it in front of the faintly outlined
figures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>&#8220;All over
but the shouting!&#8221; he jubilated. &#8220;Take them down, you fellows, while
I read them aloud to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three pencils were all the boys could muster, but these fairly leaped from
their pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what they mean,&#8221; was Bill&#8217;s prelude,
&#8220;but here they are. Forty-four, then a space, then thirty-two.
That&#8217;s what&#8217;s on the first line. Then under that is another lot,
sixty-seven, then a space, then forty-one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; yelled Lester, jumping up and clicking his heels
together. &#8220;Latitude! Longitude! We&#8217;ll find it now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s what the figures mean?&#8221; inquired Bill,
his caution still in evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think at all, I <i>know</i>,&#8221; jubilated Lester.
&#8220;It means longitude sixty-seven degrees forty-one minutes, and latitude
forty-four degrees and thirty-two minutes. Look again and see if there&#8217;s
anything about seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>But further search failed to reveal anything more than had already been
detected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, that&#8217;s near enough,&#8221; concluded Lester.
&#8220;That will give it to us within a few miles, and it&#8217;s up to us to
find the exact spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got the instruments to take the observations with and find
out just where the spot is?&#8221; asked Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I have,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a sextant <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span> stowed away in a locker
on board the <i>Ariel</i> and father has shown me how to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one, too,&#8221; put in Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. We can take independent observations and then
compare them. But come along, boys. We&#8217;re on the right trail at
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all hastened out of the forecastle, wildly excited by this latest and
most important clue.</p>

<p>It was the work of only a moment to throw off the lines, and the boats were
off at the fastest speed of which they were capable. Teddy had gone aboard the
<i>Sleuth</i>, so as to run the boat while Ross took his observations, and the
other boys took the <i>Ariel</i> off Lester&#8217;s hands for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>In a few minutes this had been done, and the boats ran alongside each other,
so that the skippers could compare notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhere within five miles from here,&#8221; declared
Lester, at the end of the conference. &#8220;Now, fellows, keep your eyes peeled
for the first big rock you see standing at the right of any opening and
we&#8217;ll put in there so quick it will make your heads swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust us to keep a close watch,&#8221; said Fred emphatically.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t let any guilty rock escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet we won&#8217;t!&#8221; echoed Bill.</p>

<p>Their excitement chased away from the boys&#8217; minds any idea of getting a
regular meal, and they contented themselves with hasty bites of whatever <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span> was found at hand, while
they kept their eyes glued to the irregular coast line.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when a shout came from Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big rock, the biggest that we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; he
cried, pointing to the right.</p>

<p>Both boats turned in the direction indicated. Ross, in his eagerness, made
his engine hum and came first in sight of a cove that opened out beyond the
rock, and a shout went up that thrilled the hearts of those in the <i>Ariel</i>
ploughing on behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is!&#8221; yelled Teddy exultingly. &#8220;Three trees
standing together and two more a hundred feet away. Now for the chest of
gold!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A DISCOVERY&#8211;CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>As the boys were unfamiliar with this part of the coast, and did not know
what depth of water they might expect to find, they had to moderate their speed,
a tantalizing proceeding when every impulse prompted them to rush ashore.</p>

<p>However, &#8220;better to be safe than sorry,&#8221; was the maxim that had
been dinned into Lester by his father, and despite the urgings of the others, he
felt his way, foot by foot, until he found a good place to drop anchor a hundred
feet from shore. Ross followed suit. Then they packed the supplies and
implements they had brought into the small boat, and rowed to the beach. Several
trips were necessary, but at last everything was safely landed, just on the
verge of dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if it were only morning!&#8221; groaned Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do much more than take a look around to-night, for a
fact,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s just as well, though, that we
have time to rest a little before we tackle the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a man-sized job, all right,&#8221; warned Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll have a week to do it in if necessary,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span> said Lester. &#8220;And
what we won&#8217;t know about this place in a week won&#8217;t be worth
knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the name of this place, anyway?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it has any name,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we christen it, then. What&#8217;s the matter with calling it
Treasure Cove?&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion met with unanimous approval, and all hoped that what they
should find would justify the name.</p>

<p>In the waning light the boys examined curiously the five trees that had
helped them to locate the place. But there was nothing cut into the bark that
gave them any clue. Nor were there any hollow places in any of them that were
large enough to contain the box they sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fred, as they retraced their steps to the sheltered
place they had picked out as a camping spot, &#8220;we can&#8217;t do any more
to-night. But I think we can be well content to call it a day&#8217;s work and
let it go at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the difference between the way we felt this morning and the
way we&#8217;re feeling now!&#8221; exulted Teddy. &#8220;Then we didn&#8217;t
know that we&#8217;d ever get within a hundred miles of it. Now, we may be
within a hundred feet of it for all we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the strain of the chase for the Cove was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> over, the boys&#8217; appetites
returned, and were all the keener because of the abstinence through the day. The
lads set to work at once and in less than half an hour they had a steaming,
savory meal prepared in the best style known to Lester and Bill, who were the
acknowledged leaders in the culinary line. They ate as only hungry, healthy boys
can eat, with digestions that asked no odds of any ostrich. Not until the last
crumb had vanished did they settle back with a feeling of absolute physical
content.</p>

<p>For an hour or more afterward, they sat around the blazing fire they had
made, discussing eagerly ways and means for the morrow&#8217;s search. All of
them were keyed up to the highest pitch. They had no definite plans except to
hunt and dig until their strength gave out, but there was not one of them, even
including cautious Bill, who did not feel sure that victory was within their
grasp.</p>

<p>They found it hard to get to sleep, but nature would not be denied and they
did sleep at last, to be awakened at the first sign of dawn.</p>

<p>They made a hasty breakfast and then got out their picks and spades, of which
they had brought enough along for each member of the party. There was no
shirking or holding back. They were like so many young hounds eager to slip from
the leash when the signal should be given.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we divide the space within easy reach from the shore into five
separate sections,&#8221; suggested <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_236'></a>236</span> Fred. &#8220;Each of us can take one and go over it
a foot at a time, as though he were looking for a needle that he had dropped. If
there&#8217;s any opening that might lead to a cave or any place where the
ground&#8217;s heaped up as if something had been buried there, then we&#8217;ll
all go to that spot and dig.&#8221;</p>

<p>But half the morning spent in this way showed nothing that was at all
unusual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing on the first try, but we can&#8217;t expect to win the
game in the first inning,&#8221; said Fred cheerily. &#8220;Now, what&#8217;s
next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; suggested Teddy. &#8220;Perhaps these trees
have something to do with it. Isn&#8217;t it natural to think that if they
buried it in the earth at all, they&#8217;d do it somewhere on a line between
the two clumps? Let&#8217;s draw a straight line from one clump to the other and
dig along that line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; said Lester approvingly. &#8220;But
instead of starting at one end and digging up every foot of the way,
what&#8217;s the matter with dividing it into lengths of ten spaces each and
digging at those points? Wouldn&#8217;t the minds of those men work in that way?
Instead of choosing distances of seven feet, nineteen feet, twenty-three feet,
wouldn&#8217;t they first think of ten, twenty, thirty and so on? It&#8217;s the
simplest way, and they were rough, simple-minded men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lester, you&#8217;re a dandy,&#8221; laughed Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span> have you elected a
professor at Rally Hall for the first vacancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though the plan was good, it yielded no results up to the time the boys
stopped work at noon to eat and rest.</p>

<p>They were not depressed, but it was only natural that their failure should
have taken some of the fine edge off their first elation. Into the mind of each
had crept the hint of the smuggler that the gold was not buried, but hidden.
They did not accept this as conclusive, but it helped somewhat to dampen their
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hot and tired,&#8221; remarked Teddy, after they had eaten
dinner, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going in for a swim before I start in
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later he was in the water and the others were not long in following
his example. All were good swimmers and they sported about indulging in all
sorts of fancy practices.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far can you fetch under water, Teddy?&#8221; called out Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch me,&#8221; said Teddy, drawing in a long breath and plunging
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>He swam with all the vigor of his sturdy young arms, helped by the current
that was running strongly with him. He stayed under until his lungs felt as
though they were bursting and he was forced to come up.</p>

<p>He was astonished to find himself in an atmosphere <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span> of twilight instead of the brilliant
sunshine he expected. His first thought was that the sun had gone under a cloud.
He shook the water from his eyes and looked up.</p>

<p>He could see neither sun nor sky!</p>

<p>For a moment panic seized him. Then he pulled himself together. He could hear
the shouts of his companions, alarmed because they had not seen him come up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he shouted, to quiet their fears. Then he
looked around him and realized what had happened.</p>

<p>He had passed under a projecting shelf of rock into what seemed to be a cave.
The water was shallow and he found that he could stand on the sandy bottom.</p>

<p>His first feeling was that of relief. His second was one of amusement at the
involuntary trick he had played on his mates. His third came to him so suddenly
that it nearly took him off his feet.</p>

<p>What was it that Mr. Montgomery had said? &#8220;<i>It&#8217;s where the
water&#8217;s coming in.</i>&#8221; In a moment of sanity, had the robbed and
wounded man seen the place where the robbers had hidden his money?</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where the water&#8217;s coming in.&#8221;</p>

<p>With legs that trembled, Teddy waded forward. He soon struck dry ground. He
went up a slight slope, feeling his way until he was above high-water mark. He
felt rough ledges as he steadied <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_239'></a>239</span> himself against the rough side of the cave and
suddenly a shock went through him that thrilled him to the finger tips.</p>

<p>On a ledge at the right, his hand rested on a box! He tried to lift it. It
was too heavy.</p>

<p>He turned and raced for the entrance, plunged into the water and reappeared
among his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found it! I&#8217;ve found it!&#8221; he sputtered
incoherently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Found what?&#8221; they yelled in chorus, already anticipating the
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The money!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Ross&#8217; money! I&#8217;ve
found the chest of gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>None of them could remember very clearly just what followed. Like so many
young otters the other boys swam after Teddy. They brought the chest to the
water&#8217;s edge, and got it into the boat that Bill had swum back to fetch.
They reached the beach, broke open the rusted lock with blows of a pick, and
there before them in the sunlight was the gold. Golden sovereigns, golden
eagles, golden twenty-franc pieces, gold that gleamed, gold that dazzled, gold
that mirrored back their own delighted faces! A great wrong had been righted,
and their persistent search had been crowned with a glorious success.</p>

<p>There were three triumphal journeys during the days that followed. The first
was to Oakland, where a widow wept happy tears because her husband&#8217;s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span> name was to stand clear
before the world and her son&#8217;s future was provided for. The second was to
Bartanet Shoals, where the kindly keeper of the lighthouse had his part in the
general jubilee. The third, and to the Rushton boys the most important of all,
was to Oldtown, where Ross, who accompanied Fred and Teddy, had the proud
delight of putting into the hands of Mr. Aaron Rushton the gold that paid his
father&#8217;s debt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what Uncle Aaron will say when he finds out the money has
been found,&#8221; remarked Teddy, when the three youths were on the way to
Oldtown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager he&#8217;ll hardly be able to believe his ears and
eyes,&#8221; returned Fred.</p>

<p>During the journey Ross was unusually thoughtful. His eyes showed his deep
delight over the mission he had undertaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t realize what this means to me,&#8221; he said to the
Rushton boys with much feeling. &#8220;It has taken a wonderful load off my
shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it from me, Teddy and I feel just as happy as you do,
Ross,&#8221; responded Fred affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad that I took that swim,&#8221; remarked Teddy,
with something of a grin. &#8220;It was worth while, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most wonderful swim in the whole world!&#8221; declared Ross,
emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! I&#8217;d like to take a swim like that again <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span> and find another
treasure,&#8221; continued the fun-loving Rushton boy.</p>

<p>When the Rushtons arrived at their home they found that their parents had
gone out on a short errand. Their Uncle Aaron, however, was on hand, sitting in
the library reading a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! Home again, eh?&#8221; said their uncle, looking at the
boys. Then he gazed questioningly at Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Ross Montgomery,&#8221; said Fred, by way of introduction.
&#8220;Ross, this is my Uncle Aaron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; came from Uncle Aaron. He gazed fixedly at the youth, who
was smiling broadly. &#8220;You look rather happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Rushton, I suppose I do, for I never felt happier in my
life,&#8221; returned Ross. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got good news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lost treasure has been found!&#8221; burst out Teddy, unable to
control himself. &#8220;Every dollar of it, Uncle Aaron! What do you think of
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found!&#8221; repeated the man. &#8220;Do you really mean
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Aaron, it&#8217;s true. The lost Montgomery fortune has
been found,&#8221; added Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am here to pay you all that is coming to you,&#8221; announced
Ross.</p>

<p>The picture that Uncle Aaron presented at that moment was one that his two
nephews were likely never to forget. He stood as if transfixed to the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span> spot, while his eyes
grew larger and larger. He clutched the back of his chair as if to support
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that I hear?&#8221; he demanded, in a strangely unnatural
voice. &#8220;You have come to pay me back all that money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Rushton, every cent of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s going to pay it to you in gold, too,&#8221; added Teddy
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Well! Well!&#8221; murmured the man. &#8220;I&#8211;I can
scarcely believe it. Why, boys, this is wonderful news!&#8221; he continued,
warming up. &#8220;Got every bit of the money, have you? Well now, isn&#8217;t
that wonderful!&#8221; His face began to beam. &#8220;And so you&#8217;ve come
to pay me what is due me, have you? Very fine of you, young man! Very fine,
indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Uncle Aaron sunk back in his chair and demanded that the three
youths give him all the particulars of the finding of the treasure. They were in
the midst of a graphic recital of these happenings when Mr. and Mrs. Rushton
arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; cried the boys&#8217; father. &#8220;I hardly expected
to see you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve found the treasure! We&#8217;ve found the
treasure!&#8221; burst out Teddy, rushing up to shake hands with his father and
then to hug his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Teddy, Teddy, don&#8217;t crush me to death!&#8221; panted <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span> Mrs. Rushton, as the
youth drew her closer and closer. &#8220;Why, I declare, I can&#8217;t
breathe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it grand news?&#8221; cried the elated boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Ross Montgomery, father,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;He, you
know, is the owner of the treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you actually found it?&#8221; returned the father, with a smile
of satisfaction. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to do
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful boys! Wonderful boys!&#8221; murmured Uncle Aaron.
&#8220;When they first came in and told me, I thought they were putting up some
sort of job on me. Say! It isn&#8217;t a joke, is it?&#8221; he queried quickly
and with sudden suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d play a joke like that, do you?&#8221;
demanded Teddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve known you to play some pretty hard jokes,&#8221; said
their uncle dryly. &#8220;But never mind that now, my boy,&#8221; he continued,
almost affectionately. &#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive you for all of &#8217;em, now
that this money has come to light. I had about made up my mind that I&#8217;d
never see a cent of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to tell us all the particulars,&#8221; said Mr.
Rushton.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what we had started to do when you came in,&#8221;
answered Ross.</p>

<p>&#8220;Teddy is the hero of this story,&#8221; broke in Fred.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the one who found the box that contained the gold
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>&#8220;Oh, come
now! Don&#8217;t put it that way,&#8221; returned Teddy modestly. &#8220;We all
had a hand in finding that box. Didn&#8217;t we all search for it day in and day
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, you are the one who really found it, and you ought to have
the credit,&#8221; said his brother firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; broke in Ross. &#8220;If Teddy hadn&#8217;t
made that wonderful dive and come up into the cave, that box might still be
where it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is queer to me that some one else didn&#8217;t find it in all these
years,&#8221; was Fred&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m mighty glad somebody else didn&#8217;t find the money
box!&#8221; cried Uncle Aaron. &#8220;But go ahead and tell the story. I want to
hear every word of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; answered Ross. And sitting down with the
others he told his tale in full, aided by Fred and Teddy.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the older Rushtons were tremendously interested
in the recital. When Mrs. Rushton heard how Teddy had made his wonderful dive
she shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my son, what a risk to take!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;What if
you had never come up to the surface again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry, Momsey,&#8221; he answered affectionately.
&#8220;I know how to take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager that the folks at Bartanet Shoals <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span> were surprised to hear
the news,&#8221; was Mr. Rushton&#8217;s comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; answered Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you should have seen my mother when she heard the great
tidings,&#8221; came from Ross, and his voice choked a little when he spoke.
&#8220;Why she was the happiest woman in the whole world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of it,&#8221; answered Mrs. Rushton, &#8220;and she
had good cause for her happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>That their parents were proud of the part that Fred and Teddy had played in
the finding, goes without saying. Their Uncle Aaron was so delighted that he
gladly wiped off the slate all his past grievances against his nephews. He even
went so far as to claim some share in what they had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it through me they went to Rally Hall?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t gone there, they wouldn&#8217;t have met
Lester or gone to Bartanet Shoals, and I&#8217;d have been twelve thousand
dollars to the bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ross had insisted on a share of the recovered money going to the Rushton boys
and Lester. The friendship between the boys had grown very strong and they were
delighted when in answer to their urging, Ross agreed to go with them to Rally
Hall. They little knew at the time that they were destined to take part in fresh
and stirring adventures before the fall term was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; remarked Fred, when he was talking it <span

brother, &#8220;we&#8217;ve had some exciting times together, but this has been
ahead of anything yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Teddy, &#8220;but I have a feeling that we&#8217;re
in for something better yet when we get back to Rally Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here let us say good-bye to the Rushton boys.</p>
